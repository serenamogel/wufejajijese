These brothless, quick-cooking meals are absolutely delicious, and you should definitely buy the best instant noodles that we’ve listed below. And don’t yell at me about Buldak! They’re getting their very own ranking.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

The noodles are thick, the sauce is delightfully sticky, and the packet is huge. After eating these, you will definitely be full and happy. Jajangmyeon (or jjajangmyeon) “is a popular noodle dish served with black bean sauce” that “was introduced by Chinese merchants, but the flavor evolved to suit Koreans’ taste buds over time” (thanks for the history lesson, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">My Korean Kitchen</a>!). You might’ve seen this dish at a restaurant topped with julienned cucumber and/or filled with ground pork, and I think either would be great with this packet of noodles to make a meal that tastes homemade. These are definitely some of the best instant noodles you can buy if you want your instant noodles to feel more like a meal than a snack.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_INSTANT-NOODLES_INSET-04.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best for Add-Ins</p><strong>Maggi 2-Minute Authentic Indian Masala Noodles</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a><p>The moment these hit my lips, I knew exactly how I’d prepare them. I’d wait until I had Indian leftovers and cook these up. Then, I’d top the noodles with leftover tandoori chicken and a drizzle of raita and mint chutney. I think that would make the most delicious leftovers revamp I could ever imagine. Don’t get me wrong, though. These are also delicious on their own. I will be keeping these on hand for quick meals in the future.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Amazon</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_INSTANT-NOODLES_INSET-03.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Sichuan-Style</p><strong>Momofuku A-Sha Tingly Chili Wavy Instant Noodles</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>We tried lots of different brands of tingly, numbing, chili oil-based noodle packets and these were the best instant noodles of that style we tasted. The wavy noodles are perfectly chewy and they cook quickly. The sauce is oily and numbing and bursting with flavor. We like A-Sha noodles in general and this collaboration between them and Momofuku is a match made in heaven. We liked these even more than the regular A-Sha noodles (which are pretty dang good)!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_INSTANT-NOODLES_INSET-02.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Most Unique</p><strong>Lucky Me!

They have a little bit of heat from the chili and they’re super tangy from the calamansi (a citrus fruit from the Philippines). I could eat these every single day. The other Lucky Me! flavors are also delicious, but these take the cake. If you’ve had these instant noodles, you know I’m right. If you haven’t had these instant noodles, get some ASAP to try.

Don’t worry if you can’t make it to Indonesia, because this version from Indomie is literally perfect. No notes. They give me this euphoric feeling in my brain and body that only the best instant noodles could invoke. They are a true flavor explosion—savory and a little sweet and a tad hot. They’re so unique that the taste is almost indescribable. They’re totally different than anything else I’ve ever had and I absolutely love them. Now that I’ve had them, I will never go without them.
