Brie Larson has been in the center of one such online urban legend that has been floating around for a while, with fans claiming she said something along the lines of ‚Äú<strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Captain Marvel</a></strong> wasn‚Äôt made for white men.‚Äù</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>The supposed quote has never been able to be sourced by anyone despite the numerous claims it exists. However, one Reddit user shared a video that they thought might have been what started the entire fiasco in the first place as it has a quote that is somewhat similar but has nowhere near the same meaning.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true><a href=#>For those people who keep insisting that Brie Larson said ‚ÄúCap Marvel is not for white men‚Äù üòÇ Yes I did my research ‚ù§Ô∏è</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Dweamers</a> in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>When this was brought up, many fans rallied to support Brie Larson, lamenting how unfairly she has been treated by many who love the MCU.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Dweamers</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Dweamers</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Dweamers</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>marvelstudios</a></figure><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>It‚Äôs also worth noting that this so called ‚Äúquote‚Äù could have accidentally came from Larson‚Äôs comments on A Wrinkle In Time. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was quoted</a> as saying:</p><p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a 40-year-old white dude to tell me what didn‚Äôt work about&nbsp;A Wrinkle in Time. It wasn‚Äôt made for him! I want to know what it meant to women of color, biracial women, to teen women of color.</p><p>Am I saying I hate white dudes? No, I am not. What I am saying is if you make a movie that is a love letter to women of color, there is an insanely low chance a woman of color will have a chance to see your movie, and review your movie.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=228 data-injectable=false>So let‚Äôs settle it once and for all ‚Äî Brie Larson never said a quote like that at all. Those who want to see her in action once more as <strong>Captain Marvel</strong> will need to wait until The Marvels premieres on November 11th, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8yaqa%2BdnGKzorrSZpirnV2ZtrSv1KyqoqaXYq5ur86nq6unppq%2FtLXApWSqrZ%2Bpsm6y0aikZpqinrJuuMCrqqimXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gaming.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>All the latest Gaming News, Reviews, Trailers and Gameplay Previews!
