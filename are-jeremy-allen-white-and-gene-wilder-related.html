It’s no wonder, either — their facial features and signature dirty blond curls make for quite a resemblance. It’s also a highly flattering comparison, as the late actor is widely considered a master of both comedy and drama.</p><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>Since the trailer for Wonka (2023) dropped, those less-than-impressed with Timothée Chalamet’s casting as the iconic Roald Dahl character have thrown Jeremy Allen White’s hat into the ring as a preferred choice to take over from Wilder — although Jeremy might have preferred that suggestion come from social media users prior to the new film starting production.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>Recently, rumors have spread online that the two actors are biologically related, and with such a striking resemblance, who can blame the believers?</p><h2 id=h-so-are-gene-wilder-and-jeremy-allen-white-actually-related-then data-injectable=false>So, are Gene Wilder and Jeremy Allen White actually related, then?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>In a December 2023 puppy interview with Buzzfeed, discussing the new movie The Iron Claw, Jeremy Allen White finally addressed the rumors of his relation to Gene Wilder – with the help of co-stars Harris Dickinson and Zac Efron.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>When asked the question “what’s the craziest rumor you’ve heard about yourself?” Jeremy brought up the internet’s burning question.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>“I’m not related to Gene Wilder,” the 32-year-old stated outright. “I think a lot of people think I am.”</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>“I’ve addressed it before, but [the rumor] is still a thing.”</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Hearing about this urban myth immediately brightened up Zac and Harris, who hadn’t heard of the rumor before. “That’s hilarious!” Efron replied. Soon, the actors started teasing their co-star.</p><p data-characters=115 data-current-count=115 data-injectable=false>“Are you Gene Wilder?” Harris quipped, causing Jeremy to jokingly reply “I am Gene Wilder!”</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=false>Given the popularity of Buzzfeed puppy interviews, Jeremy has probably put the rumors to bed for good – he is not related to Gene Wilder, and their shared likeness is a mere coincidence of the DNA jackpot – but then again, addressing it in the past has done little to prevent such widespread speculation. If there is any connection between the two beloved actors, it’s so distant that Jeremy is unaware of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yivsRmoZ6qlaLGbq3LpZynZaedtrWxjJqlnWWXmrumedaio52domK%2FprjArZydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./keene-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Keene Williams</span></a>
