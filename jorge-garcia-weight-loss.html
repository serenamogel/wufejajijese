A student of the Beverly Hills Playhouse acting school, Jorge got into acting at a relatively young age.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional life</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before his big-break, Jorge spent six years at Borders Books and Music while trying out different auditions. Jorge was just getting by with normal roles here and there until he was picked by the TV series Lost. The series which aired from 2004 to 2012 let Jorge into the path of stardom while also winning him an ALMA Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Television Series (2006),(2008)&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series (2006).

They have remained friends and still support each other’s work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did he lose Weight?</h2><p>It is no secret that Jorge has regularly struggled with his weight. For instance, in the series “Lost” his character was trapped in a deserted island. The producers asked Garcia to lose weight as his character was trapped. While Jorge did manage to lose the initial 30 pounds in time for the show, he was frustrated by the progress and went back to his unhealthy eating habits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/George-garcia-weight-loss.jpg><p>Recent reports suggest that Jorge underwent gastric bypass surgery to lose some weight.
