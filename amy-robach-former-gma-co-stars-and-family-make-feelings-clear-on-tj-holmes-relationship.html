At the time, Amy and T.J. were put on leave for several weeks while ABC News President Kim Goodwin and the team behind GMA3 figured out the next steps surrounding the couple's future.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd99051578c4-tj-amy-official-launch.jpg><p id=eIpgxP03ew data-wc=27>The decision was made at the end of January, when on January 27, ABC released a statement confirming that they had parted ways with Amy and T.J.&nbsp;</p><p id=edY4LZJ3DR data-wc=59>"After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes about different options, we all agreed it's best for everyone that they move on from ABC News," it read.

A decision for new co-hosts of GMA3 and 20/20 will come later."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/89635b0634de-amy-tj.jpg><p id=eEzJraiJnz data-wc=40>The couple stayed out of the public eye for almost eight months following their official dismissal, but at the end of August, they both returned to Instagram to share the news of their upcoming participation in the New York Marathon.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8DnQB6Pk4 data-wc=53>Since then, the pair have both shared regular updates on their training, as well as several personal posts.
