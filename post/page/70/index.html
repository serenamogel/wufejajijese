That's acting. There's a line of dialogue in the movie that I jotted down at the time, and it's been cited by several critics. Bad Blake is being interviewed in his shabby motel room by Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a newspaper reporter. She's taking him, gently, to places he doesn't want to go. He's been interviewed about the subject too many times. He doesn't say that. He says, "I want to talk about how bad you make this room look.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Trudy Cathy White Net Worth, Age, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki 2024</h2><time>Feb 29, 2024</time>
