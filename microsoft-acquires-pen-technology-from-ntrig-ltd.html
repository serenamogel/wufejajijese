They even had a pen with a supercapcitor rather than a battery, which will give you a month’s charge on the pen in five seconds of charging.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9212/FreshPaint_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Microsoft has been key to show off uses of the pen during the Build conference this week, and there are a lot of apps which make use of inking including the Staff Pad app that they showed which can be used by music writers to compose music. The other obvious ones are apps like One Note, where you can quickly jot down notes or drawings. Microsoft’s Fresh Paint also is fantastic with the pen, and my six year old daughter has been loving that app.</p><p>Details of the sale were not made public at this time.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Surface Blog</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZzfZFopKKboqTAsLLTZpicqaWev6a%2FjKmcp2WkmrCpus6lpqCxXZu%2FsLmMp6uroZdiubWw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./georges-st-pierre-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Georges St Pierre Net Worth</span></a>
