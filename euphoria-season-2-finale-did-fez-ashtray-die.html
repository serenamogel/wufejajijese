Let's go even a step further: there have been a lot of polarized opinions on Season 2 of Euphoria. But if there was one thing that every Euphoria viewer had in common, it may have been shouting out some sort of GOB Bluth-esque "Come on!" when the words "To Be Continued..." read on screen at the end of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a39127647/euphoria-season-2-episode-7-recap/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Season 2 Episode 7" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Season 2 Episode 7</a>, the penultimate chapter of the season. While the episode was built around Lexi's (Maude Apatow) play and everything that came along with it, the biggest tension of the episode was at Fez's (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a28237201/fez-euphoria-angus-cloud-hbo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Angus Cloud" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Angus Cloud</a>) house. And with his seat at Lexi's play empty, there was worry for both him and Ashtray with their drama unfolding. And then the episode ended, we got absolutely no relief to that tension, for better or for worse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">After a full week of waiting, we finally got to see how it all played out. While the Euphoria Season 2 finale continued the drama that happened literally in Lexi's play, on the stage of Lexi's play (with full out Maddy vs Cassie mayhem finally breaking out), and inspired by Lexi's play (Nate turning Cal in to the police), it was still what was happening to the guy who was missing Lexi's play that was the most compelling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">We've been worried about Fez and Ashtray, and with the season opening with their origin story—a Goodfellas-eque story about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a38747363/euphoria-fez-grandmother-actress-kathrine-narducci/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Fez's Grandma" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Fez's Grandma</a>, and how he not-by-choice inherited the drug operation from her—Season 2 was essentially build around them. So it makes sense that it would come to a close with major fireworks.</p><img alt="fez euphoria season 2 finale" title="fez euphoria season 2 finale " width=2880 height=1518 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2022-02-27-at-10-33-44-pm-1646019976.png><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd1">HBO</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">And major fireworks were had. Some of the last episode's tension was broken quickly, when Faye began to help Fez out, aware that Custer was trying to get Fez to say something incriminating about Mouse's death on his phone. And while Faye was saying all the right things (instead pointing the finger at Laurie), Ashtray was too trigger happy, jumping and stabbing Custer in the neck.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">And this was the beginning of the real finale drama. With the police on their way, something was going to happen. And something, indeed, did happen.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Did Fez die in the Euphoria Season 2 finale?</h2><img alt="fez euphoria season 2 finale" title="fez euphoria season 2 finale " width=2880 height=1544 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2022-02-27-at-10-32-33-pm-1646019380.png><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd1">HBO</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Fez doesn't appear to have died in the Euphoria Season 2 finale. But he's in bad shape no matter any way you shake it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">After Ashtray killed Custer, Fez knew there was no winning in that situation. While he quickly destroyed Custer's phone by dropping it in a full Big Gulp cup, his first reaction, with the authorities on the way, was to take the fall for Ashtray. He hit him in the face, put the murder weapon knife in his own hand, and told Ash to give himself up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">But Ash instead just didn't listen, stockpiling weapons in the bathroom and shooting through the door. When a SWAT team eventually showed up and broke into the house, Fez was blocking the door trying to get Ash to come out; Fez quickly complied with the SWAT team, but his efforts to get Ash to come out failed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Once Ash started shooting a high-powered gun through the bathroom door, the SWAT team returned fire, and Fez was stuck in the middle. He got shot in the stomach and it looked very bad. But he continued yelling for Ash to stop shooting and come out, so he was at least OK enough to do that, and he smartly remained on the ground for all of this.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">At the end of the episode, we see him being taken away—hurt, but still alive.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Did Ashtray die in the Euphoria Season 2 finale?</h2><img alt="fez euphoria season 2 finale" title="hbo ashtray season 2" width=2880 height=1544 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2022-02-27-at-10-32-13-pm-1646019427.png><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd2">HBO</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The outlook for Ashtray is significantly worse—he is most certainly dead. While the classic rule of television is "they're not dead unless you see a body," we'd figure the case of not seeing Ashtray's body is more in the "don't kill a kid on-screen" classic rule of television.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">We did see Ashtray firing guns like a mad man, we did see him stab a drug dealer in the neck, and we did see him play dead before shooting a SWAT team member in the chest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">The last thing we'll likely see of Ash on Euphoria is the SWAT rifle's laser pointer on his forehead. Let's hope that Fez—and everyone in his orbit—are able to cope with whatever comes next in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a38986603/euphoria-season-3-trailer-cast-news-release-date/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Season 3" class="body-link css-16fs9zm et3p2gv0">Season 3</a>.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.menshealth.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt='preview for Javon "Wanna" Walton | Train Like' title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/javon-walton-tl-1656536411.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHNrJ%2BemZyptW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSudIWRbmpvbmhksra8x6ipopldqLKiv86nZGtllp67orjEZpuinF2bsrt5wKyfraqRrnqltcRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-daviss.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Daviss | Pope, Outer Banks, Netflix, Family, Age, Birthday, Siblings, Sisters, Instagram, C</span></a>
