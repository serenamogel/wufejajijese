The short feature was a depiction of one of the book's more notable scenarios — when the gang first encounters Judge Holden and he teaches them to make gunpowder in order to ward off an attacking horde of Indians. Franco's project was designed as a proposal to copyright holders to attain film rights to the novel, and rumors of a feature-length motion picture proliferated shortly thereafter (via <a href=#>Indie Wire</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>"We made [the screen test] as a way to convince Scott Rudin to give us the rights,"&nbsp;Franco shared with <a href=#>EW</a> in 2011.&nbsp;"It was like, why should he give it to me when Ridley Scott didn't make it? So I called him up and said, 'I'm planning on doing this. You don't have to give me any money, I can finance this shoot. I showed it to him and he loved it." <a href=#>Deadline</a> reported in 2016 that, despite efforts from James Franco and a team of others including Russel Crowe, a cinematic depiction of "Blood Meridian" was no longer — or likely never was — in the works. Initial conversations about the prospective feature were ultimately squashed, and no such rumors about a Franco-directed "Blood Meridian" film have surfaced since.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEj2ltamtfrLW6ecKoqaaZk2K6pK%2FAq6uhsaNir7PB05qjZq%2BVqMGmvs1mpaiulaF6rq3YZqWerpWneq6typ5koqxdqbxuwMeeZJuhl2LApL7EnqVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./slideshow-u-s-navys-dolphins.html><span>←</span><span>Photos: U.S. Navys dolphin and seal program</span></a>
