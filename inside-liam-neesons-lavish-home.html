The property spans 37 acres and takes full advantage of the natural landscape alongside the 200-year-old mansion.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>The centerpiece of the estate, Neeson’s home is a colonial-style mansion of which the living space takes up over 6,000 feet. The house, which was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly built in 1810</a>, has plenty of space, and each bedroom is equipped with an adjoining bathroom. It isn’t noted how many bedrooms are in the home, but from its original real estate listing, it seems that there are many along with plenty of living areas to relax and entertain.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Any movie star needs a place to watch a film in style, and Neeson’s home is of course equipped with a state-of-the-art home theater. Neeson can further relax by playing a game of golf without ever leaving the house thanks to the golf simulator inside. You can check out images of many of these features compliments of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Realtor.com</a>.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>There is also what appears to be a full-size gym and massage room in the residence, so the actor can satisfy all of his fitness and recovery needs. You’ll also find an indoor pool with a stunning view of the property, all without leaving the comfort of the home.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>As you head outside, you’ll find plenty more to experience. Of course, there’s an outdoor pool also for when Neeson prefers to do laps outside in the sun. There’s even a full-size tennis court to take advantage of alongside a modern patio area to sit and relax in the outdoor atmosphere. The property is also home to a lake just a short wander from the mansion and a large greenhouse where home-grown food is produced.</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=false>Further away from the main house is a pair of restored barns, with one of them home to the ultimate entertaining space. Inside, Neeson is said to have one of the most gnarly projector setups around, with a massive screen, ample speakers, and a top-of-the-line projector. Also inside is reportedly a game room and much more, making it anything but your typical barn ⏤ which makes sense, honestly, given that from his stellar career to his staggering net worth of $145 million, little about Neeson’s life can be classified as typical.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2r7%2FInZxmpJmWum66xJ6qqKajYrmiwsisn2agn6KycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./philip-chism-wikipedia-how-old-is-he-now.html><span>←</span><span>How Old Is He Now ?</span></a>
