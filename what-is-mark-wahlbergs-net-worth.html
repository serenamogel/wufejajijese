Our approach to life becomes less brash. Our grow less funky. And, with any luck, our investments begin to pay dividends. Take, for example, the case of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Wahlberg</a></strong>. Once, he was a firebrand, fly-by-night pop star, then a rising actor. Then everything changed when he starred in Boogie Nights, the universally-acclaimed story of a man (Wahlberg) who waits until he goes to bed to pick his nose. Full disclosure, I never saw Boogie Nights.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>The financial prognosticators over at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, through divination and considered accounting, have put Wahlberg’s estimated personal holdings at a staggering $400 million. They also say that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leonardo DiCaprio has around $300 million</a> to his name. “Mark Wahlberg has more money than Leonardo DiCaprio” might not sound right to your ears, but if you phrase it slightly differently – “Mark Wahlberg could buy more fighter jets with flames painted on their sides than Leonardo DiCaprio” – it’s a fact that goes down a little easier.</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>The secret to Wahlberg’s success and, by extension, Leo’s relative failure, lies in the fact that nobody would go to a restaurant called “DiCaprese Salads.” Mark Wahlberg’s chain of Wahlburgers restaurants, which he shares ownership of with escaped proto-Wahlbergs Donnie and Paul, is 50 chains strong, generating an estimated $100 million a year.&nbsp;At a $10.99 price point, that’s enough to buy 6 million Our Burgers with Paul’s sauce and pickles and still tip the waitstaff generously.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mark-wahlberg-uncharted.jpg><p data-characters=830 data-current-count=1130 data-injectable=true>Additionally – and this is true, ask your friends – Mark Wahlberg stars in blockbuster movies, which is a pretty solid line of work to be in, financially speaking. With <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Transformers: The Last Knight</a>, Daddy’s Home 2, and All the Money in the World, he became the highest-paid American actor in 2017. Reuters reported his earnings that year at $68 million, beating out Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s pathetic, emasculating $65 million and probably making him feel tiny and weak. Then there are the ad spots. With Hollywood fame comes the promise of endorsement deals, and the 52-year-old actor has made bank on those as well, earning a reported $10 million for his work representing AT&T alone. It’s not wonder the singer of Good Vibrations enjoys a 33% higher personal worth than the star of Titanic.</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=240 data-injectable=false>More than any of that, though? Do you know what Mark Wahlberg has that Leonardo DiCaprio doesn’t? A high school diploma. He graduated in 2013 at age 42. DiCaprio never did. Stay in school, kids. It could mean a difference of $100 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZ2Wv6x51pqfpZqVp7S0ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heres-how-much-hunter-biden-is-really-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Here's How Much Hunter Biden Is Really Worth</span></a>
