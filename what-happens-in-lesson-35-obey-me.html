This is because — as angels that were created, not born — none of the brothers are related by blood to begin with.</p><h2>Do choices matter in obey me?</h2>While selecting different choices may allow a player to initiate differing situation responses or character dialogue, none of the choices players make affect the main storyline.<h2>What food does Beelzebub like?</h2>chat, he states that his "type" is someone who can make mountains of food for him.

We don't indulge people who actually want to date Luke. The minute you stand up for him against Lucifer is the minute his playground crush begins. He thinks you're amazing!<h2>Can 12 year olds play obey me?</h2>Considering the nature of gameplay, the suggestive themes, and the heavy pressure on players to spend money, overall we find Obey Me! to be unsuitable for young players under 18.<h2>Are Beelzebub and belphegor twins?</h2>Belphegor is the youngest demon brother in the otome game Obey Me. He appears as the avatar of sloth and the twin brother of Beelzebub.<h2>Can you date all the brothers in Obey Me?</h2>Obey Me! is marketed as an otome game, but not in the traditional sense.

Little is currently known about him, though he initially seems to have an unfavorable opinion of MC.<h2>What is Mammon the avatar of?</h2>Described as 'greedy', 'stupid', and 'scummy', I didn't expect to like Mammon. However, as I spent more time in the Devildom and got to know 'The Great Mammon' – as he calls himself – I realised there was more to this perpetually-indebted Avatar of Greed than his lust for money.<h2>Who is the 4th brother in Obey Me?</h2>Satan is the Avatar of Wrath and is the 4th oldest and physically the youngest among the seven demon brothers.
