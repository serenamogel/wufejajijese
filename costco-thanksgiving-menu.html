Plus, your wallet will certainly thank you. Even if you’re rich and flush with disposable time, these Costco Thanksgiving products are still the move because they’re all so, so tasty.</p><p>Note: Prices may vary based on the location of Costco and the exact portion size of the product.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-appetizer-kirkland-signature-shrimp-tray-15>The Appetizer: <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kirkland Signature Shrimp Tray</strong></a><strong> (<strong>~</strong>$1</strong>5)</h2><p>We love the Costco shrimp tray!

Making homemade mashed potatoes can take forever and this saves you all that trouble. As the name implies, they come loaded with bacon, two kinds of cheese, butter and sour cream. Who doesn’t want bacon and butter in their mashed potatoes?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-side-kirkland-signature-organic-fine-green-beans-12>The Side: <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kirkland Signature Organic Fine Green Beans</strong></a><strong> ($12</strong>)</h2><p>You need something green to round out your Costco Thanksgiving and these organic green beans are perfect.
