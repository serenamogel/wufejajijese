So vivid, so cool, and poignant, it was like he was in the studio singing live. With Freddie’s vocal solo on the mixing desk, my appreciation for his gift was taken to an even higher level.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While their musical legacies remain somewhat intertwined, their personal friendship ended up waning. “I think he now just stays at home. He doesn’t like coming out at all,” Mercury also said in the interview with Robinson. “He says whatever he wants, he can get at home. Anything he wants, he just buys it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And that kind of lifestyle just wasn’t for Mercury: “That’s not me, but that’s his bag. I wouldn’t do that. I would be bored to death. I go out every night. I hate staying in one room for too long anyway. I would just like to keep moving. Just an individual approach.”</p><img alt="February 7, 1984 at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Natural History in New York City.
