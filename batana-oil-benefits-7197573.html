It can be used to hydrate and moisturize the scalp — which helps achieve luscious locks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To learn more about batana oil and its benefits, we spoke with Robinson and Dr. Lauren Penzi on whether the botanical can bring moisture back to our skin (and hair!) and how best to use it in your routine.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ron Robinson</a>&nbsp;is a cosmetic chemist and founder of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>BeautyStat</a>.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Lauren Penzi, MD</a>, is a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology: Medical Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for more information on batana oil, including its benefits and the potential side effects you may experience.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-batana-oil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Batana Oil?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Batana oil is a yellow-colored liquid substance extracted from the nut of the American palm tree. It is said to help keep the skin moisturized. As for hair, batana oil encourages growth and even repairs some damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the name of the tree it comes from, it's important to acknowledge batana oil's Latin American roots. According to Dr. Penzi, its history goes back to Honduras — where it's traditionally been used for beauty products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The native Miskito people of Honduras have used it for hundreds of years — they have referred to it as 'miracle oil' as it has helped them to grow longer, stronger hair and also has many benefits for the skin," she added.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>For skin</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best thing about implementing any oil into your beauty routine is its benefits.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Given [batana oil] is rich in vitamins and Omega-6 fatty acids, it can work as an emollient to help moisturize the skin," noted Robinson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is a surprising benefit to batana oil that isn't found in most natural oils on the market: It protects our skin health against UV rays. (That said,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>using a traditional SPF</a>&nbsp;is still critical.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Batana oil has tocopherols and tocotrienols that act as antioxidants, protecting the skin against UV rays and environmental pollution while fighting free radicals that lead to photodamage," explained Dr. Penzi.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>For hair</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As we mentioned above, the Miskito people from Honduras swear by batana oil's hair benefits. For example, it helps with hair growth and prevents hair loss. Moreover, its saturated yellow color can even help dye lighter hair — especially if it's platinum blonde, gray, or white. Of course, it provides your hair the shinier look we're always chasing.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-potential-side-effects></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Potential Side Effects</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As with any natural botanical product, there is always a risk of an allergy or sensitivity to the product, manifesting as redness, scaling, itching, and so forth," said Dr. Penzi.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, you shouldn't be too worried. Batana oil is generally safe for all skin types, noted Dr. Penzi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, everyone's skin tolerance is different. Before slathering any product or new skin care ingredient on your face, do a patch test or consult your dermatologist. If you're testing it at home, Dr. Penzi advised applying a small amount to your inner forearm for two to three nights in a row.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If no reaction occurs, you should feel comfortable to start using the product on your face," she said.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-using-batana-oil-in-your-skin-care-routine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Using Batana Oil in Your Skin Care Routine</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are plenty of ways to incorporate batana oil into your routine to make your skin feel and look amazing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This oil can be incorporated into facial cleansers, moisturizers, and masks," said Robinson.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, please don't overdo it. According to Dr. Penzi, implementing this ingredient a few times a week is more than enough. If your skin is dry or dehydrated, she recommended using the oil one to two nights a week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have oily or acne-prone skin, she said to use the oil as a first step in your regimen, followed by a water-based cleanser to avoid clogging the pores.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-using-it-in-your-hair-care-routine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Using It in Your Hair Care Routine</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to how you'd want to patch test batana oil on your skin, you'll want to follow that process before you douse your hair in it. After all, your scalp is still skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You don't have to pick a place on your scalp for a patch test, though. In fact, you can use the results from the patch test you conducted on your forearm. If you didn't experience a reaction, you're good to use this on your hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To do so, dispense about a quarter-sized amount on your palms before massaging it into your hair. You can leave it in for a half-hour and then wash it out.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skin care to sustainability practices,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a>&nbsp;is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZqrmqaRYryquIybnKedlp7BtHmWanBwbWdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./samantha-cope.html><span>←</span><span>Samantha Cope Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
