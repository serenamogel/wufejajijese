Sculptures from this era showcase various styles and adornments — some extravagant and complicated to denote high status (like the ornaments, hairpins, and metal plates worn by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>the Luba peoples</a>), while others opted for simple and short looks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These practices have trickled down to contemporary Africa, and across the diaspora, where in visualizing what seems to be a normal hair day — an experience that many people with African ancestry will resonate with — there is a celebration of the seemingly simple; the forgone, the little dignities in loving and sometimes struggling with hair. And that's at the center of what it means to be virtuous, to be malleable, to experience, and to come out still loving, still beautiful, and more resilient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is why hair will never just be hair to Black people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our hair is deeply rooted in culture, tradition, and way of understanding the world. And for many women of African descent, hairstyling is about the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From detangling to hours spent choosing a hairstyle, buying deep conditioners from three different brands because your regular one is sold out — these are all a part of the experience of doing our hair, especially when it has not been tended to for a while.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carlos Idun-Tawiah</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The journey begins before one even makes their way to a salon or welcomes their home-based braider. But the pride associated with the artistry of our hair does not deflect from the reality that this process is not necessarily always enjoyable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our delicate strands require gentle care and a specific type of patience. Our arms are guaranteed to hurt after long hours of styling, and the comb you use to separate and part the hair may snap altogether. But once again, even the unfavorable parts of styling reflect the deeper meaning of a new stage of life or new status, despite the challenges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you opt for African threading, however, the process can be quick and easy when your stylist's hands, whether they're your own or someone else's, are used to deftly wrap the jet black yarn around the hair shaft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This style has existed in many Ghanaian and Nigerian cultures for centuries, and today makes a statement for people owning what is seen as "old school." It's also a safe alternative for those who want to stretch and grow their hair without the application of heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Threading is versatile in how it makes hair sit even more boldly or bend into patterns that almost immediately spark deep interest.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carlos Idun-Tawiah</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Salons across the continent of Africa and throughout the diaspora are located everywhere from outdoor spaces to high-rise buildings, but there is still a striking sense of instant intimacy regardless of the location.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether wedged between stylists masterfully weaving extensions and hair together, or cooped up under the dryer, conversation and opinion both never fail to filter through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Popular culture gains a whole new meaning in the almost roundtable-like discussions. Humor comes and goes as easily as soft shea butter melts into the kinks and knots of our strands, with local movies becoming the subject of intense debates.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the hair is ready, these styles can be embellished with gold <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>accessories</a> to finish each look, which has made a huge resurgence in the past few years and are a continuation of the precedent set in traditional African societies. From delineating family and ethnic association to being passed down generations, adornments are yet again a reminder that nothing simply just <i>is </i>with African hairstyling. Hair is intention re-patterned, community strengthened, and history stitched over and again.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Carlos Idun-Tawiah</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once it's done, getting up after long hours on a stool is relieving, and everything seems to fast forward as one pays, leaves, and heads to their next destination. You feel new again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The city you're in takes on new meaning. Drinks with friends have an extra zing to them that surpasses ingredients or flavor — it's the joy of looking and feeling <i>good. </i>And that captures what hair can mean, especially to a people still discovering what has been taken away.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hairstyling is radical care for oneself. It is radical care for the community. Hair is home. It has always been right where we are.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And nothing — not theft, dilution, or barriers — can take away what has always been meant to be for us.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>Model: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Christell Kattenstroth</a>. </i><i>Photography: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Carlos Idun-Tawiah</a>. </i><i>Direction: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Josef Adamu</a> of </i><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow><i>Sunday School</i></a>. <i>Production: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5>Ekow Barnes</a>. </i><i>Asst.
