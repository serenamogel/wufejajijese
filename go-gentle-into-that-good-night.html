No need to spell them out. I believe that if, at the end of it all, according to our abilities, we have done something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves a little happier, that is about the best we can do. To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn't always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/go-gentle-into-that-good-night/8_van-gogh-shoes-thumb-300x241-6635.jpg alt=8_van-gogh-shoes.jpg height=241 width=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span>In a moment or a few years, maybe several, I will encounter what <a href=#>Henry James</a> called, on his deathbed, "the Distinguished Thing." I may not be conscious of the moment of passing. I have already been declared dead. It wasn't so bad. After a ruptured artery following my first cancer surgery, the doctors thought I was finished. My wife Chaz said she sensed that I was still alive, and communicating to her that I wasn't finished yet. She said hearts were beating in unison, although my heartbeat couldn't be discovered. She told the doctors I was alive, they did what doctors do, and here I am, alive.</p><p>Do I believe her? Absolutely. I believe her literally--not symbolically, figuratively or spiritually. I believe she was actually aware of my call, and that she sensed my heartbeat. I believe she did it in the real, physical world I have described, the one I live in with my wristwatch. I see no reason why such communication could not take place. I'm not talking about telepathy, psychic phenomenon or a miracle. The only miracle is that she was there when it happened, as she was for many long days and nights. I'm talking about her standing there and knowing something. Haven't many of us experienced that? Come on, haven't you? I admire Skeptic magazine, but I'm not interested in their explanation or debunking of this event. What goes on happens at a level not accessible to scientists, theologians, mystics, physicists, philosophers or psychiatrists. It's a human kind of a thing.</p><p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/go-gentle-into-that-good-night/9_Vincent_Van_Gogh-Seminatore_al_tramonto-thumb-300x231-6638.jpg alt=9_Vincent_Van_Gogh-Seminatore_al_tramonto.jpg height=231 width=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>Someday I will no longer call out, and there will be no heartbeat. What happens then? From my point of view, nothing. Absolutely nothing. Still, as I wrote today to a woman I have known since she was six: "You'd better cry at my memorial service."</p><p>I have been corresponding with a dear friend, the wise and gentle Australian director <a href=#>Paul Cox</a>. Our subject sometimes turns to death. In 1988 he made a luminous documentary named "<a href=#>Vincent: The Life And Death Of Vincent Van Gogh</a>." Today Paul wrote me that in his Arles days, van Gogh called himself "a simple worshiper of the external Buddha." Paul told me that in those days, Vincent wrote:</p><p>Thank you, good Paul. I think that is a lovely thing to read, and a relief to find I will probably not have to go on foot. Or, as the little dog Milou says whenever Tintin proposes a journey, pas à pied, j'espère!</p><p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/rogers-journal/go-gentle-into-that-good-night/x6_tintin_milou-thumb-300x202-6641.png alt=x6_tintin_milou.png height=202 width=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></p><p>Footnote: At the urging of a reader, I took <a href=#>this quiz. </a>It evaluated my replies and, from a list of 27 religions or belief systems, informed me that my top five categories were: 1. Secular Humanism (100%); 2. Unitarian Universalism (92%); 3. Liberal Quakers (80%); 4. Nontheist (73%); 5. Theravada Buddhism (71%). That was sort of what I expected.</p><p><strong>Below: A poetry reading by the peerless <a href=#>Tom O'Bedlam.</a></strong></p><p><strong>somewhere I have never traveled, by e. e. cummings.

Why? I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take a train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star. We cannot get to a star while we are alive any more than we can take the train when we are dead. So to me it seems possible that cholera, tuberculosis and cancer are the celestial means of locomotion. Just as steamboats, buses and railways are the terrestrial means. To die quietly of old age, would be to go there on foot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq6eXmr9uscGeqa1nl6R6qLHNraOeZZmjwbB506GYrWWXpLylec2inqGs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./watch-yennefer-and-tissaia-reunite-in-new-clip-for-the-witcher-season-2.html><span>←</span><span>Watch: Yennefer and Tissaia reunite in new clip for The Witcher season 2</span></a>
