According to Burisma, Biden's role was giving advice on issues of "transparency, corporate governance and responsibility, international expansion, and other priorities," via <a href=#>Bloomberg News</a>. They paid him upwards of $50,000 a month for these somewhat vague duties, according to <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. Almost as nice as making more a month than <a href=#>most Americans make a year</a>, Biden also had a pretty sweet work-from-home situation: not once did he visit the war-torn country, according to <a href=#>Reuters</a>.</p><p>Many experts dubbed Biden's role suspect: "It's a big deal.
