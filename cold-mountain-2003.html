<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Cold Mountain movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2003)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The movie stars <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> as Ada Monroe, the daughter of a Charleston, S.C., preacherman (<a href=#>Donald Sutherland</a>) who has moved to the district for his health. The first time she meets Inman (<a href=#>Jude Law</a>), their eyes lock and a deep unspoken communication takes place. Inman, as shy and awkward as a ploughboy in a ballet, contrives excuses to be standing about slack-jawed when she comes into view, but she has mercy on him, and after he has joined the Confederates and gone off to fight the war, she observes, "I count the number of words that have passed between us, Inman and me -- not very many. But I think about it." So few are their meetings, indeed, that later in the story they're able to count off on their fingers every time they have seen each other, and it doesn't take long enough to make us restless.</p><p>Ada's father dies, leaving her as a poor city girl to farm the land, something she is ill-equipped to do. A sensible neighbor lady dispatches an energetic young woman named Ruby (<a href=#>Renee Zellweger</a>) to help out, and Ruby sets to work splitting rails, milking cows, wringing turkey necks and expressing herself of opinions so colorful <a href=#>Garrison Keillor</a> would blush with envy. Ruby and Ada are also prepared to stand in their doorway with a rifle when necessary, just as well, since the home guard is captained by Teague (<a href=#>Ray Winstone</a>), who figures Inman isn't going to come home, and that Ada will need a man to protect her -- against Teague, for that matter.</p><p>Inman witnesses one of the most horrible battles of the war, in a set-piece that director <a href=#>Anthony Minghella</a> and production designer Dante Ferratti can be proud of. After Union troops tunnel under Confederate lines and set off powerful explosives, the position caves in -- but not with the expected results. The Union men, pushed forward by those behind them, are hurled down into the vast bomb crater, and it's a "turkey shoot" as the Confederates pick them off.</p><p>That Inman jumps down to save a friend is unwise, that he survives is unlikely, and that he decides to heed the latest letter from Ada and walk away from the war and back to her is unsurprising.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cpqWcXaK8trrTmqCnZWJlfXQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andrea-burchill.html><span>←</span><span>Andrea Burchill movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
