<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Did Lupita Nyongo And Jared Leto Ever Date? What Really Happened?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>When she played Patsey in Steve McQueen’s critically praised movie “12 Years a Slave” in 2013, Lupita Nyong’o shot to prominence. After winning an Oscar for best supporting actress for the part, Nyong’o gained a permanent position in the spotlight. Since then, Nyong’o has enjoyed a prosperous acting career, appearing in box office hits including “Us,” the “Star Wars” prequel trilogy, and the “Black Panther” movie series.</p><p>She has also assimilated into Hollywood’s elite, socialising frequently with Oprah and Brad Pitt, and Forbes magazine named her one of Africa’s 50 Most Powerful Women. When discussing her A-list status with Elle, the Kenyan-Mexican actor remarked, “I am aware that being an African woman on a Hollywood stage is not something you see every day, and I appreciate that. And I registered for it. I would not exchange it.”</p><p>Despite being a well-known figure for many years, Nyong’o has been able to keep a large portion of her private life hidden from the public. Her love history has been a closely guarded secret, although over the years, a few famous people have been linked to her, including Jared Leto, who memorably referred to Nyong’o as his “future ex-wife” at the Independent Spirit Awards back in 2014. He told Nyong’o as he accepted the award for best supporting actor, “I’m thinking about you, sweetie,” according to Us Weekly. Was there any truth to the relationship rumours, though? Did Nyong’o and Leto actually date? Listed below is everything we know about their alleged liaison.</p><h3>Lupita Nyong’o joked about her rumored romance with Jared Leto</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lupita-nyongo-joked-about-her-rumored-romance-with-jared-leto-1669742953.jpg alt="jared leto and lupita nyongo movie,lupita nyongo net worth,is lupita nyongo married,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and jared leto 2022,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and trevor noah,jared leto and lupita nyong&amp;#039;o movie,jared leto wife,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and winston duke,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o net worth,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and jared leto,why wasn&amp;#039;t lupita nyong&amp;#039;o in infinity war,who has lupita nyong&amp;#039;o dated" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lupita Nyong’o and Jared Leto initially ignited dating speculations when they were frequently seen together during the 2014 award season. At the 86th Academy Awards that year, both actors—Nyong’o for her work in “12 Years a Slave” and Leto for his portrayal of Rayon in the smash hit movie “Dallas Buyers Club”—won the best supporting actor awards.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u67ee303e68d527928d5c8a0ce033fd1e><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Lupita Nyong’o Is Offically Dating Selema Masekela - Know Who He Is</span></a><p>According to Page Six, Nyong’o and Leto were spotted cuddling up at the Crosby Street Hotel in New York City in February 2014, a month before the Oscars, while out on what appeared to be a date.</p><p>An observer described the two as “huddled at a corner table together, seeming extremely close.”</p><p>But when questioned about Leto on “The Ellen Show” a few weeks later, Nyong’o merely laughed and made fun of the romance rumours.</p><p>She referred to another piece of tabloid rumour involving Leto and Cyrus, saying, “Ah, but I thought Miley Cyrus broke us up.”</p><p>The last thing I heard was, “That.”</p><p>It’s crazy, she continued, “because these stories are so precise that even I start to wonder if they’re true or not.” I know I’ve previously trusted them, but I guess I can’t believe anything now. Leto himself remained silent at the time regarding the claims, but he did spoke to OK! Magazine about having a “special” connection with Nyong’o. It is a really unique occasion because “we were both nominated for Academy Awards,” he told the publication. “You two are in the same class, right? Similar to the class of 2014”</p><h3>Lupita Nyong’o seemingly confirmed rumors she dated Jared Leto</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lupita-nyongo-seemingly-confirmed-rumors-she-dated-jared-leto-1669742953.jpg alt="jared leto and lupita nyongo movie,lupita nyongo net worth,is lupita nyongo married,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and jared leto 2022,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and trevor noah,jared leto and lupita nyong&amp;#039;o movie,jared leto wife,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and winston duke,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o net worth,lupita nyong&amp;#039;o and jared leto,why wasn&amp;#039;t lupita nyong&amp;#039;o in infinity war,who has lupita nyong&amp;#039;o dated" width=390 height=219 sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lupita Nyong’o admitted in a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter in October that she may have dated Jared Leto after all, despite initially denying they were romantically involved. In a rare interview, Nyong’o discussed her personal life and her rumoured relationship with the vocalist from the band 30 Seconds to Mars while talking about her new movie “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.” “Why did I keep it a secret? Simply put, I want some things to be for me alone, and I want my work to speak louder than my love “said Nyong’o, who has recently been linked to Janelle Monáe and Michael B. Jordan. “And I genuinely detest the thought of having to confront my ex-lovers in public. I don’t need to see their faces.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u9f7e7e164cfd01150b76f489523d1e2a><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Al Pacino's Hilarious First Encounter With Jared Leto's As House Of Gucci Character Paolo Gucci</span></a><p>In her cover story for Net-a-digital Porter’s magazine Porter Edit from earlier in 2019, the “Us” actor spoke more about her unique relationship with Leto and the lessons she’s learned since becoming a successful Hollywood star.</p><p>“Jared Leto, he’s still on fast dial,” Nyong’o stated when listing the celebrities who have had a significant impact on her life. This is because the two of us went through the Oscar campaign together, and he is incredibly supportive of me.</p><p>She then acknowledged that although though the “Morbius” actor and she were never a legal marriage, they did grow close. The intimacy that resulted from that, Nyong’o said, “went beyond the dating rumors, beyond all that.”</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="jared leto and lupita nyongo movie,lupita nyongo net worth,is lupita nyongo married,lupita nyong'o and jared leto 2022,lupita nyong'o and trevor noah,jared leto and lupita nyong'o movie,jared leto wife,lupita nyong'o and winston duke,lupita nyong'o net worth,lupita nyong'o and jared leto,why wasn't lupita nyong'o in infinity war,who has lupita nyong'o dated" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
