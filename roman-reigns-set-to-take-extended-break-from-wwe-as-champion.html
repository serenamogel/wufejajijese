One fan tweeted out to say, “If Reigns is indeed planning a sabbatical. Does he take the titles with him indefinitely.”</p><p>In reply to this question, the proven WWE insider tweeted back, “yes.” That seems to give the indication that SmackDown will be without a top champion soon enough. Only time will tell how long that break will last.</p><p>When asked whether Roman Reigns will leave WWE this year, another fan received a reply saying, “No, but less schedule with time.” It appears that Roman Reigns will get even more time off in 2023.</p><p>Roman Reigns doesn’t work very many television events at this point, picking his appearances for when it matters. That is why it’s<a href=#> such big deal when he wrestles at a house show. </a>Pretty soon, seeing the Tribal Chief live will be considered a very rare treat.</p><p>We will have to see how things progress in the next year or so. The Bloodline saga doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to ending, at least not while Roman Reigns has a tight hold of WWE’s top spot.</p><p>What’s your take on Roman Reigns taking a long break as Undisputed WWE Universal Champion?
