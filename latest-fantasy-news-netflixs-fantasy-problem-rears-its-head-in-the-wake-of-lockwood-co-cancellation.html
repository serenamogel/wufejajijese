Netflix’s decision to cancel the popular Lockwood & Co. one season in isn’t sitting well with fantasy fans, who’ve started to realize that maybe the platform simply isn’t equipped to handle our fantasy favorites with the care and respect they deserve.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>The Warrior Nun fandom has been clued into the issue for awhile now, but the latest Netflix misstep is only lending fuel to their fire, as they work to gain the favor — and a renewal — of an alternate (and increasingly superior) streaming service.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Some harsh conversations are popping off among fans of the genre, whose weariness with Netflix’s love for cancellations is hitting a high point. Its causing widespread strife, as fan-favorite shows are pitted against each other and&nbsp;faith in Netflix plummets to unprecedented lows. A mass exodus is all but guaranteed to follow, if Netflix doesn’t get itself sorted out — and soon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-netflix-cancels-lockwood-co-and-signs-its-own-death-warrant data-injectable=false>Netflix cancels Lockwood & Co., and signs its own death warrant</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lockwood-co.jpg><p data-characters=699 data-current-count=999 data-injectable=true>Lockwood & Co. isn’t necessarily the end-all be-all of Netflix offerings, but its cancelation might just be enough to ruin the streamer’s reputation — at least among fantasy fans. The platform’s apparent addiction to greenlighting hugely popular adaptations, only to ax them within their first few seasons, has become part of its brand, and it’s not a good look. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lockwood & Co. is just the latest</a> in a years-long string of fantasy cancellations, and fans of the genre <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are getting sick</a> of putting their faith in doomed properties. They reacted to news of the show’s cancellation with outrage, and blasted Netflix for shattering any remaining faith subscribers had in its future.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Too many cancellations put anxious Netflix users at odds</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lockwood-and-co-heartstopper.jpg><p data-characters=715 data-current-count=1015 data-injectable=true>The aftermath of Lockwood & Co.‘s cancellation has seen fury on a steep rise, though not everyone is directing it Netflix’s way. While the streamer is inarguably to blame for the devastating array of lost favorites, fans of the latest axed series are turning their ire on the streamer’s un-cancelled shows. Its not fair to compare a series like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lockwood & Co. to Heartstopper</a>, given the two show’s distinctly different stories, tones, and general themes, but its hard not to notice the discrepancies between them. The numbers don’t lie, and Lockwood was distinctly more popular than Heartstopper, so why is the latter returning for a second season while Lockwood fans lose out?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>But those axed fantasy shows are the least of its problems</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Netflix_fantay.jpg><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=864 data-injectable=true>At the end of the day, Netflix’s problems started long before it set its sights on our favorite genre. Its never had a great grasp of the fantasy genre as a whole, and its continued lack of faith in the materials its choosing to adapt burns subscribers time and again. I, for one, am entirely sick of putting my faith in a new series, only to find myself let down — first, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">by the shoddy decisions</a> made by Netflix and its creatives, then again when the plain product I learned to love gets shown the door. What’s the point of this subscription, again?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Particularly as subscribers catch wise, and lose faith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Netflix_distracted_boyfriend.jpg><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Look, I’m shamelessly plugging my own work at this point, but I have a feeling you might agree. I’m frustrated, to no end, by how Netflix has been treating our favorite shows, even when we fight tooth and nail to see them return. I know the Warrior Nun fandom knows what I’m talking about. Despite months of effort, the streamer continues to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ignore broad fan demands</a>, even as it renews shows with much smaller viewer bases. Make it make sense!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Warrior Nun’s Halo Bearers ditch Netflix for greener pastures</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/warrior-nun-4.jpg><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=false>The mass exodus of fantasy fans is starting with Warrior Nun, as the campaign to save the show — cancelled by Netflix after two hugely popular seasons — turns its back on the series’ former home. After nearly six months of silence from Netflix, the Halo Bearers are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">instead setting their sights</a> on HBO Max, where they hope the show can return and give viewers some long-overdue closure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytrdOeqq1llpa7ta3SsmSnnaeoeq%2Bx05%2BjorCjYrOiutOaqrJloKe8o7jEpmSrnZGnwG6106xkoZ2RmXqquoytn55lp5a4pnnOn2Slp5OgxLC7w2aaqGWTlruksculmK2hn6N8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kamil-mcfadden.html><span>←</span><span>Kamil Mcfadden Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
