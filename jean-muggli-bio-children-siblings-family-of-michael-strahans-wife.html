to me She is not one of those celebrities who are known for their profession.&nbsp;However, her dedication to athlete Michael Strahan is the basis on which she rose to fame.&nbsp;Fans were curious how she weathered the ugly media frenzy caused by falling out with her ex-husband, a well-known American soccer player.&nbsp;Here’s everything she was up to and more.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jean Muggli – biography</span></strong></h2><p><span>Muggli was born on November 20, 1965 and grew up in the United States of America with her sister Denise Muggli.&nbsp;She deliberately kept the details of her parents and her early childhood to herself.&nbsp;However, it was noted that she had a great childhood and also suffered from anorexia as a child.</span></p><p><span>As a child suffering from anorexia, Mugglioft was disturbed by her physical appearance and was overly protective of her looks and body size.&nbsp;In an effort to stay fit, she skipped meals and was very energetic with exercise.&nbsp;“</span></p><p><span>Regarding her educational pursuits,” said JeanMuggli completed her college education at an undisclosed institute in New York City, after which she embarked on her numerous endeavors in the world of beauty and cosmetology.&nbsp;Before she retired from the limelight while still married to superstar Strahan, she held the post of cosmetics store manager in the big city of New York.&nbsp;She currently resides in North Dakota with her two daughters.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family of Michael Strahan Wife (children)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jean Muggli was once married to Michael Strahan, a former American football defenseman who spent his entire 15-year career with the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL).&nbsp;The former couple first met when Jean Muggli was working as a cosmetics store manager.</span></p><h3><strong><span>How they met</span></strong></h3><p><span>In a candid interview, the couple agreedthat their love was from the first time.&nbsp;The two met at the cosmetics store that Jean managed.&nbsp;Michael, who is very reserved, did not immediately approach the lady, but instead visited the store daily for a month just to see her.</span></p><p><span>For her part, Jean Muggli understood his tricks and played along, although she had her reservations as she never wanted to date an athlete.&nbsp;Over time, Jean Muggli realized that Michael was not a normal athlete.&nbsp;He had a different personality than other men in the same field as him.&nbsp;Soon, Michael and Jean began a relationship, and on July 18, 1999, they officially declared their union.</span></p><h3><strong><span>marriage and children</span></strong></h3><p><span>Michael’s marriage to Jean was not his first, having been divorced at the time and previously married to Wands Hutchins, with whom he had two children;&nbsp;a daughter and a son before marriage broke up.</span></p><p><span>Years after Jean and Michael got married, they welcomed identical twin girls, Sophia and Isabelle.&nbsp;The family lived together peacefully until all hell broke loose in 2005.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Jean Muggli’s divorce</span></strong></h2><p><span>Jean reportedly came out in March 2005 allegations that Michael was violent with photo evidence of her injured body.&nbsp;She also claimed he hit her to the point of affecting her kidneys and kept her in turmoil for days.</span></p><p><span>With all available evidence, she filed for a divorce on the grounds that the athlete was no longer fulfilling his marital obligations to her.&nbsp;Furthermore, Jean Muggli claimed the athlete was obsessed with her sister Denise and put a hidden camera where she gets dressed.</span></p><p><span>While all of this was going on, Michael Strahan, on multiple platforms, successively denied the allegations that his wife needed to explain the reasons for withdrawing $3.3 million from his accounts at the time.</span></p><p><span>Both parties were very into mischief and of course things got really dirty.&nbsp;In court, the judge hearing the case found no specific justification for the evidence presented by Jean Muggli and dismissed the assault case, allowing both parties to divorce on July 20, 2006.</span></p><p><span>There is currently no news on Jean Muggli’s whereabouts, but her ex-husband has long since moved on and is pursuing his career.</span></p><h2><strong><span>siblings</span></strong></h2><p><span>The only known sister of Jean Muggli is Sister Denise.&nbsp;The sisters were raised together by their unknown parents but have taken different paths.&nbsp;While Jean is in the limelight, her sister lives very far away.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also
