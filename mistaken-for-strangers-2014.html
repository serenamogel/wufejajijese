<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Mistaken for Strangers movie review (2014)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Instead it's more of a gently amusing and ultimately poignant Can and Not Able tale, about a rising rock star and his younger slacker sibling as they try to lessen the gulf between them created by one's great success and the other's countless failings. In tone, it's somewhat similar to "<a href=#>American Movie</a>", the 1999 cult doc about an ill-equipped filmmaker's misguided yet determined attempt to make a horror film at the expense of his own personal life.</p><p>While there are plenty of scenes of Matt and his musical bandmates in action while rehearsing and on stage, Tom's lack of focus and general air of ineptitude (the first question he asks his brother on camera: "On tour, it's day in and day out—does that ever make you sleepy onstage?") lends a meandering raggedness to his attempts at capturing the band's reality. That leads a frustrated and impatient Matt to inquire, "Do you have any kind of organization and plan for this film?"</p><p>The one actual plan in place is to have Tom pay his way by working as a roadie, a job whose few requirements—moving equipment, providing refreshments along with towels and water for the band during performances, keeping track of the VIP guest list at concerts (<a href=#>Werner Herzog</a> pops up in Los Angeles)—seem to be beyond his capabilities. Instead, he tapes himself getting drunk on the tour bus, peppers the busy crew with inane queries and captures evidence that dishearteningly confirms his brother's idol status, including a live appearance alongside President Obama. Not helping matters is that Tom is a metalhead who considers his brother's introspective songs with their cryptic lyrics to be "pretentious bull----."</p><p>You don't have to be a fan of the band to be touched by these disparate souls. It does help if you have endured or been either version of these brothers—black sheep or golden child. Ultimately, it is the differences between Tom, who looks like a short-and-stout version of his tall, lanky brother, and Matt that are most fascinating to observe.</p><p>Matt, married with a young daughter and a home in Brooklyn, is a complete professional and looks it onstage in an all-black uniform of a suit coat, dress shirt, vest, tie and denim trousers. He is subdued although prone to anger, primarily whenever Tom fails to follow orders and acts irresponsibly. Tom, who doesn't even own a set of dishes and feels unready for a girlfriend even though he is in his early 30s, prefers shorts, T-shirts and purple flip-flops. He is lackadaisical, often thoughtless and insecure about his ability to do just about anything.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46moKyskaCyr3nFqKlmq6Snrq%2BzxKuqZmpgZoE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demetress-bell-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Demetress Bell Net Worth 2024</span></a>
