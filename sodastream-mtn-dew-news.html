It was like the second coming of the soft drink world, but instead of turning water into wine, it turned water into soda—arguably a more exciting feat for most American dads. In the beginning, you could make everything from plain ol’ bubbly water to sparkling Crystal Light, Fanta, Sunkist, Ocean Spray, and off-brand versions of Coca-Cola, Sprite, Dr. Pepper, and Root Beer. Nowadays, they have a Pepsi partnership that has granted them the right to release Pepsi, Starry, and Bubly name-brand flavorings. But just this month, Pepsi has handed over the keys to the proverbial soda castle. The soda mix to end all soda mixes: Mtn Dew. Yes, you read that right. Now we can all DIY (Dew It Yourself) our favorite caffeinated, highlighter-colored soft drink.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-will-sodastream-mtn-dew-actually-taste-like-mtn-dew-will-it-still-be-that-yellow-or-that-caffeinated>Will SodaStream Mtn Dew actually taste like Mtn Dew? Will it still be THAT yellow? Or that caffeinated?</h2><p>We won’t know the answers to these questions until the product hits the market, but we can make some educated guesses. For instance, in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a side-by-side tasting of the current Pepsi SodaStream and straight-up Pepsi</a>, it would seem that while you can tell the difference, it’s not enough of a difference to make the experience any less enjoyable. So my thought is that this stuff might actually taste like Mtn Dew. As for how yellow it will be, the publicity images make it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">look pretty darn yellow</a>, if not ever so slightly less yellow than the actual premixed product, but that could also depend on how much syrup you add. And lastly, when it comes to caffeine, we have every reason to believe this stuff will be caffeinated. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SodaStream Australia already has a Mtn Dew flavor</a> and that one is caffeinated, but it is also a much paler hue than the Mtn Dew we know and love here in the U.S., so it might not be a 1:1 comparison. That said, a lot of the SodaStream flavors already sold in the U.S. contain caffeine including the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pepsi one</a>, so I don’t see why they would stray from the formula specifically for the Mtn Dew offering.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Leaked Updates on 3 New Mtn Dew Summer 2024 Flavors</a></strong></p><p>So if you are a SodaStream owner (or an avid Mtn Dew fan), I have some good news for you. Sure, you could wait and get the flavor pods online for $6.99 when they come out on February 1 and risk that they’ll sell out before you can get your hands on them, or you could reserve some ahead of time. That’s right. If you want the chance to order up to three bottles of the new Mtn Dew (but make it homebrew), you can go to their website <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and enter your info. Apparently, you will receive a text or email notification 48 hours before the Mtn Dew SodaStream mixes (Zero Sugar, Diet, and Regular Unleaded) become publicly available and, at that point, you will have the option to place an order early and get free shipping. If you are at all thinking of buying some of this stuff, it truly can’t hurt to throw your name in there. In the words of my good pal Nike, just Dew it—and be sure to let us know if you dew or dew not taste a difference.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKufma60wNGemKZlnam7brDEsGSnnaeofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-betts.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Betts- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage</span></a>
