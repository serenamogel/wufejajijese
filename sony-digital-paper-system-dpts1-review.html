<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Concluding Remarks - Sony Digital Paper System DPT-S1 Review</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Concluding Remarks</h2><p>The Sony DPT-S1's feature set and pricing make it clear that business users are the primary target market. Posts on various e-reader forums indicate that the device is gaining popularity amongst academics and lawyers. Despite the business / enterprise focus, there is nothing preventing power users from using it as a standard e-reader. In fact, the device, when used in the landscape mode with a two-page thumbnail view (a feature introduced in firmware v1.5.50.1180 released on December 15, 2015), can simulate holding a real book with two pages side by side. The availability of a pen / stylus can also lend itself to some interesting applications for casual users. Writing on the plastic surface of the Sony DPT-S1 feels closer to writing on actual paper compared to glass surfaces in other tablets.</p><p><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/9860/solve-crossword_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Sony DPT-S1 - Not Necessarily an 'all work, no play' Device</p><p>Even though I try to avoid printing out documents / papers and read them on a computer monitor or tablet, I can't totally avoid the usage of a printer. Since purchasing the Sony DPT-S1 a couple of weeks back, I haven't printed out a single document. One of the aims of the Sony DPT-S1 is to reduce paper clutter. I have to say that it succeeds nicely in this respect.</p><p>Coming to the business end of the review, we will analyze the pros and cons of the Sony DPT-S1 first.</p><p>On the plus side:</p><ul><li>The unit is lightweight, yet solid. The experience is very similar to carrying a folder with a few sheets of paper.</li><li>The unit has great ergonomics and is perfectly size for technical documents</li><li>It is a great vehicle to bring out the advantages of E-Ink<ul><li>No strain on the eyes, thanks to the absence of backlighting</li><li>Visibility under bright light / outdoor environments is perfect</li><li>The battery life is great - more than a couple of weeks between charges even with regular use (2 - 3 hours a day with a page or so of writing on each day)</li></ul></li><li>Annotation capabilities with the pen input is great for note taking and other business uses.</li><li>It reads all PDFs - no messing around with DRM, no proprietary file formats, no 'cloud' accounts needed</li><li>Combination of features make it a very unique product in the market</li></ul><p>On the other side:</p><ul><li>The exorbitant pricing (<a href=#>$800</a>) makes it unsuitable for personal use. There exists better value for money if an E-Ink screen is not a must</li><li>The PDF viewer could do with some more features to make it more versatile / suitable for non-business use-cases. (more zooming, adjustable cropping to remove white margins etc.)</li><li>Firmware, in general, could do with some extra features - such as providing additional options for network shares along with the currently existing WebDAV support.</li><li>Limitations of E-Ink<ul><li>Low refresh rate can hamper user experience when redrawing the screen during document navigation / zooming</li><li>Absence of color capabilities</li></ul></li><li>Adding audio capabilities could help expand the addressable market (targeting audiobooks, for example)</li><li>At the $800 price point, the presence of just 4GB (3GB usable) of internal flash is disappointing. Availability of a microSD slot alleviates this issue somewhat.</li><li>A more powerful processor could help in providing a better user-experience with graphics-heavy PDFs.</li><li>Absence of contrast adjustment (something possible in the Kindle-DX) is a bit disappointing</li><li>There is no built-in light for reading in the dark (something available in the Kindle Paperwhite)</li><li>Wear-out of the pen tips could be a worry for heavy users</li><li>Navigation buttons at the bottom could do with a more pronounced feel. The current design (flush with the rest of the frame) is more suitable for capacitive touch-based implementations.</li></ul><p>Despite the list of potential improvements and drawbacks being longer than the positives, the Sony DPT-S1 gets my recommendation for being a unique product in a specific niche. Products based on the 13.3" E-Ink Mobius screen have also been shown at tradeshows by companies like Netronix and Pocketbook, but they remain vaporware.</p><p>If the characteristics of E-Ink screens fit your requirements and you need a size-for-size replacement for traditional paper documents, the <a href=#>Sony Digital Paper System DPT-S1</a> is the perfect fit. It does a surprisingly great job despite being the only such product in the market. We hope Sony continues to provide firmware updates for the product and bring the price down even further.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIZ5go9oqqimqWKxqrPIrZilZaCWvaa%2BjKywrKyVonqlvNOsaGaqlau2psOObQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toshiji-takeshima.html><span>←</span><span>Toshiji Takeshima movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
