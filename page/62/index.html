The Coens took the name of their character from the real-life name of one of the more villainous figures in backstage Hollywood history (he was played by Bob Hoskins in the much darker Tinseltown riff ‚ÄúHollywoodland‚Äù), but this entirely fictional Mannix is a harried ordinary-joe exec, ‚ÄúHead Of Physical Production‚Äù for a studio called Capitol Pictures.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Michael Evans Behling Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Mar 27, 2024</time>
