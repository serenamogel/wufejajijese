On Twitter, he lets his inner K-pop fan out when ARMYs and STAYs. I noticed him liking two messages about the groups. Fans have realized that the days-old tweets aren’t there by accident because they’re still in his Likes section.</span></p><p><span>In the past, the Canadian actor has expressed his affection for various K-pop idols such as EXO. HyunA, and Eric Nam. Ryan Reynolds is fulfilling every K-pop fan’s dream, from photoshopping himself as an EXO member to a Deadpool photoshoot with HyunA. His most recent Twitter incursion revealed that he is a K-pop enthusiast beneath the actor’s image.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1tmjrlSh_400x400.jpg><h2>According to fans, Ryan Reynolds is like tweets about BTS and Stray Kids.</h2><p><span>Ryan Reynolds, an A-list Hollywood actor, liked tweets about the two current hot K-pop groups, BTS and Stray Kids, a few days ago. The event was discovered after fans of the band noticed the posts on his Twitter account’s Likes section. It didn’t come as a surprise, given that he had previously expressed his affection for K-pop groups, but it caught them off guard.</span></p><p><span>BTS’ Jimin’s concert countdown post was one of the two tweets the actor liked. The idol captioned two selfies with “D-4.” Wait a little longer. #JIMIN #PTD ON STAGE SEOL #IfWeAreTogeth WeDontNeedPermission.”</span></p><p><span>The other was a Stray Kids fan translation account that was live-tweeting leader Bang Chan’s Chan’s Room Ep. 147. During the live stream, the idol discussed the gift he received from Reynolds: a bottle of Aviation American Gin, which he co-founded.</span></p><p><span>The leader stated that the gin’s smell was too powerful for him, so while he doesn’t drink it because it is a “prized property,” he does take a whiff of it whenever he is sleepy.</span></p><p><span>Reynolds and Stray Kids became acquainted after the actor noticed a fan edit video. A clip from Deadpool has been linked to a scene. From the group’s Deadpool-inspired performance of God’s DDU-DU DDU-DU on Mnet’s Kingdom.</span></p><p><span>The actor then sent the leader a signature Aviation Gin, who sent him an autographed record. Fans were pleasantly surprised when the star subscribed to his Bubble account.</span></p><p><span>Reynolds previously revealed that he was a BTS fan by liking Jungkook’s exercise video. Though the actor did not state it, the group’s tweets convinced followers he was an ARMY member.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>BTS And Stray Kids</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ryan Reynolds</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipspmeYr%2Bmxc2oo52rXZrFsb7ErKqeq12dtrR5wJ2koqqRqbawuoyfpqtlkqnAbq3NnWSsrKKWxm63yJ2qZqeeYsG4tdOtnKtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./plan-75-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Plan 75 movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</span></a>
