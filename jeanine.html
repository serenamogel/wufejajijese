They make this soup supremely quick and easy. It’s just the thing for nights when you’re really craving the comfort and convenience of takeout, but you somehow convince yourself to cook dinner anyway. And if you cook this dumpling soup, you’ll be glad you did! The potstickers and veggies float in a fragrant broth that’s spiked with garlic, tamari, and lots of fresh ginger. It’s warming and flavorful, and the fact that it comes together in under 30 minutes only makes it taste better.

It’s bursting with meaty sautéed mushrooms. Along with a splash of white wine and Parmesan cheese, they pack this pasta with rich, umami flavor. I don’t use heavy cream in this recipe, but it’s still lightly creamy. Starchy pasta water and a pat of butter bring the mushrooms together into a silky sauce that coats the pasta. It’s savory, delicious, and all about the mushrooms. If you’re a mushroom fan, you have to try it! What You’ll Need for Mushroom Pasta The star ingredient in this mushroom pasta recipe is—of course—mushrooms!…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These vegan enchiladas are seriously delicious. Whenever I make them, my husband Jack and I fight over the last one. For context, Jack might be the world’s biggest cheese lover. If he’s going after cheese-less enchiladas, you know they have to be good. The filling here is a hearty mixture of mushrooms, peppers, and black beans. I roll it up in corn tortillas and then smother them with red enchilada sauce and homemade vegan nacho cheese. Before serving, I sprinkle garnishes like jalapeños, radishes, and avocado on top. This vegan enchiladas recipe is comforting, but also fresh. The rich enchilada…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This banana bread recipe is the best way to use overripe bananas. Now that we have a little one in the house, we’ve been buying a LOT more bananas than we used to. Sometimes (ok, often), we don’t get to all of them before they ripen, and I end up with a heap of dark brown, spotty bananas on my counter. Banana bread to the rescue! But not just any banana bread. While some popular recipes call for 2 or 3 bananas, this banana bread recipe calls for 4. I love that it lets me use up lots of ripe…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Quesadillas! They’re delicious, satisfying, and—most importantly—EASY. They’re one of my favorite back-pocket meals, something I can whip up using basic ingredients when I need a simple dinner or work-from-home lunch. I’ve made a lot of them over the years, and I’ve learned some handy tips and tricks for making them along the way. I’m sharing them all in this quesadilla recipe! What is a quesadilla? A quesadilla is Mexican dish that consists of a heated, filled, and folded tortilla. Quesadillas originated in central and southern Mexico, and they were first made with corn tortillas and filled with Oaxaca cheese.

It’s creamy, it’s cheesy, and it’s perfect for scooping up with tortilla chips. Just make sure to hit up the snack table right after it comes out of the oven. This bean dip disappears QUICK! And I haven’t told you the best part yet: this bean dip recipe is easy to make.&nbsp;It calls for refried beans (you can use canned or homemade), so instead of blending the dip in a food processor, you can simply stir it together in a bowl. Spread it in a baking dish, sprinkle it with cheese,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This homemade refried beans recipe is delicious and easy to make. It calls for just 10 basic ingredients, and it’s creamy, flavorful, and bright. If you’re used to eating canned refried beans, get ready—these homemade ones are SO much better! Refried beans, or&nbsp;frijoles refritos, are a staple of Mexican and Tex Mex cuisine. Their English name is a bit misleading, because they’re not re-fried at all. Instead, cooked beans are added to a skillet with onion, garlic, and spices and then mashed until thick and creamy. Packed with fiber and protein, they’re a delicious, healthy side dish for tacos, enchiladas,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>These sweet potato fries are about to become your new favorite snack.&nbsp;They’re easy to make in the oven. They’re PACKED with sweet and savory flavor. And they’re crispy too! Paired with a tasty dipping sauce, these baked sweet potato fries are impossible to resist. This sweet potato fries recipe is an updated version of a baked sweet potato fries recipe I shared several years ago. What’s changed? Well, if you’ve ever made sweet potato fries in the oven, you might know that it’s hard to get them crispy. I thought I’d tried every trick in the book—soaking them in cold…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This chipotle sauce will punch up any meal! It’s smoky, creamy, tangy, and easy to make with simple ingredients. I started making the recipe to put on the cauliflower tacos in my first cookbook, and now I love it on everything from burrito bowls to breakfast tacos to hearty salads. If you try it, I think you’ll fall for it too! I say this all the time, but I truly believe that the key to a great veggie meal (or any meal, really) is a great sauce. This creamy chipotle sauce is one of the best—it adds SO much flavor…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Ribollita, a classic Tuscan soup, is the definition of a delicious meal made with simple ingredients. We’re talking really simple—this flavorful Italian soup was originally a way to stretch leftovers. It was made by reheating bean and vegetable soup and adding day-old bread to thicken it. In fact, ribollita means “reboiled.” My ribollita recipe doesn’t start with leftovers. But in the Italian tradition, it does deliver rich flavor with basic ingredients. I begin by sautéing onion, carrot, and celery in a generous glug of olive oil. Then, I add garlic, fresh rosemary, and a splash of white wine. When the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This air fryer vegetables recipe shows off everything I love about air frying. First, it’s quick and easy. These air fryer veggies cook in half the time it takes to make roasted vegetables in the oven! Second, it’s delicious.&nbsp;The air fryer vegetables are perfectly tender, with crisp, caramelized edges. Bonus: garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice add tons of great flavor. If you have an air fryer (this Instant Omni Plus is my favorite), these air fryer vegetables should definitely be in your rotation. They’re so simple to make, and they’re healthy and flavorful.
