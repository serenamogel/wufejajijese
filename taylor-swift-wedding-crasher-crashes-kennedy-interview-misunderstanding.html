I responded with a very clear, ‘Please do not come.’ They came anyway. … I personally went up to Ms. Swift, whose entrance distracted the entire event, politely introduced myself to her, and asked her as nicely as I could to leave. It was like talking to a ghost. She seemed to look right past me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>On August 23 on Today, Kathie Lee confirmed Vicki’s story, saying that Conor Kennedy had not RSVP’d to Vicki’s daughter’s wedding. He asked Vicki if he could bring his girlfriend — Taylor. Vicki politely said no but then he came with her anyway. Vicki reportedly asked Taylor to leave the event twice.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kathie Lee saw Conor take Taylor’s hand and leave but Kathie Lee didn’t realize the drama that was going on until she saw it in the papers the next day.</p><h3>Taylor Speaks Out On Wedding Crashing Incident</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Taylor responds in the October 22 issue of Rolling Stone, saying:</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I have no idea what happened there. I think that story was based on the biggest misunderstanding, ’cause I would never knowingly show up somewhere that I thought I wasn’t invited to. And I would never want to upstage anybody.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Taylor admits that she doesn’t read stories about her and banned Googling herself after a flat performance at the 2010 Grammy Awards.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I don’t think anyone is ever truly viewed as only one thing, as only good, as only well-behaved, as only respectful. In the beginning, when there would be a tiny news story about something that wasn’t true, I thought that meant my fans weren’t gonna show up to my next concert. But now, knock on wood…I feel like my fans have my back and I have theirs.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Are you glad Taylor addressed this scandal, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><strong>More Taylor Swift News:</strong></p><li><a href=#>Taylor Swift: In Love With Conor Kennedy & Patrick Schwarzenegger? — Report</a></li><li>Taylor Swift Releases Vengeful New Song — Who Is It About?</li><li>Taylor Swift Reveals Title Song ‘Red’ — Admits She’s Not Over Her Ex</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWliZH5xe5BpZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2ssqWwyKeeZpuilsCpsdFmmquZo52ytHnKnqWnnZSueqq6056pr6GVrHqutdKupZ2doqjBorrDoqWgZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rose-zhang-net-worth-and-salary.html><span>←</span><span>Rose Zhang Net Worth and Salary</span></a>
