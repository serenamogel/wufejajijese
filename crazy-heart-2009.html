<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Crazy Heart movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2009)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>That's acting. There's a line of dialogue in the movie that I jotted down at the time, and it's been cited by several critics. Bad Blake is being interviewed in his shabby motel room by Jean Craddock (<a href=#>Maggie Gyllenhaal</a>), a newspaper reporter. She's taking him, gently, to places he doesn't want to go. He's been interviewed about the subject too many times. He doesn't say that. He says, "I want to talk about how bad you make this room look."</p><p>It's such a good line I can hardly believe I've never heard it before. Bad Blake perhaps knows it sounds like something out of an old movie. It's also the kind of line written by a singer-songwriter, the masking of emotion by ironic displacement, the indirect apology for seedy circumstances. She blushes. I can't think of a better way for the movie to get to where it has to go next. No shy apologies. No cynicism. Just that he wrote a great line of a country song, and it was for her.</p><p>Bridges, Gyllenhaal and <a href=#>Scott Cooper</a>, the first-time writer-director, find that note all through the movie. It's like a country-western cliche happening for the first time. Bridges doesn't play drunk or hung over or newly in love in the ways we're accustomed to. It's like Bad has lived so long and been through so much that he's too worn out to add any spin to exactly the way he feels.</p><p>Bad Blake was a star once, years ago. He has lyrics that go, "I used to be somebody, but now I'm somebody else." His loyal manager (Paul Herman) once booked him in top venues. As "Crazy Heart" opens, Bad is pulling up to a bowling alley. "It's this year's 'The Wrestler,' " one of my colleagues observed after the screening. Yes. Bad still has a few loyal fans, but you get the feeling they've followed him to the bottom. He has a son he's lost touch with and hasn't written a good song in a long time. In the old days, he toured with a kid named Tommy Sweet (<a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>). Now Tommy is a big star, but contrary to the conventions of such stories, hasn't forgotten his old teacher and remains loyal.</p><p>Maybe, we're thinking, with the love of a good woman Bad could turn it around. It's not that simple in "Crazy Heart." Jean is a good woman, but can she afford to love this wreck 25 years older than she is? Certainly not if he continues to drink, and maybe not in any case. And it's not easy for Bad to stop drinking; he's descended below his bottom.</p><p>How does Bridges do this without making the character some sort of pitiful and self-pitying basket case? The presence of <a href=#>Robert Duvall</a> here, playing his old friend and acting as one of the producers of this movie, is a reminder of Duvall's own "<a href=#>Tender Mercies</a>" (1983), another great film about a has-been country singer and a good woman (<a href=#>Tess Harper</a>). It's a measure of Bridges, Duvall, Gyllenhaal and Harper that they create completely different characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cqZqyqWK1pq3RrWRraGBu</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wolfgang-mozart.html><span>←</span><span>Wolfgang Mozart - Requiem, Facts &amp;amp; Death</span></a>
