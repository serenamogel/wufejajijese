A relationship that he says “really formed the backbone of the first film. So it was like, why did we just eject that massive weapon?”</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>The storyline in X-Men: First Class leaned heavily on how Charles Xavier and Magneto became best friends and the events that caused them to become archenemies. Theories of a romantic subtext between the two mutants have existed ever since the first iterations of the characters were created in the comic, but McAvoy and Fassbender’s portrayals added even more fuel to the fire that is Cherik, the name for the romantic partnering – or “shipping” – of Charles and Erik.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>james #1 cherik shipper <a href=#>https://t.co/e3U77Sct0K</a></p>— magnolia • andor era (@padmemagnolia) <a href=#>November 28, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>McAvoy just flat out going <a href=#>https://t.co/RwD4Ze2XoA</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HRjGWC9pmj</a></p>— flynnboyant (@flynnboyant) <a href=#>November 28, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I support this 100%.

That being said, it remains to be seen whether we will get an older version of Professor Xavier in the MCU, such as the one we saw in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, or a younger version.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>If the MCU does go younger (or heck, younger and older – this is the multiverse we’re talking about), it’s unclear who will play the character. McAvoy has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already made his stance on the situation clear</a>. In a dream world, both McAvoy and Fassbender would reunite to do the character justice, but Hollywood’s tendency to err on the side of queerbaiting and McAvoy’s apparent lack of interest, make the future of the characters seem bleak.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>At least we have X-Men: First Class and Days of Future Past to return to; two films that stand high above the pack as clear winners in the franchise’s unstable history. Both films are available to stream on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqllah6rq%2FAr6ayZaOdrrOx0maqrqigpL%2B1ecWoqWasmJ7AbrPAsmSxZZ2au26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mmKecXaKus8LEpWSfmZ6oeqK%2BxGapop%2BYqXq1tMSrnGavmam1brTIpmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./go-gentle-into-that-good-night.html><span>←</span><span>Go gentle into that good night | Roger Ebert</span></a>
