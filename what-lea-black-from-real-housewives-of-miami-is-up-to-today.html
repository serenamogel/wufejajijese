And while other series such as "The Real Housewives of New Jersey" were better known for their table-flipping antics, "RHOM" seemed more subdued in comparison. Still, Lea doesn't seem interested in getting involved in fabricated drama for the ratings. Speaking about the reboot, Lea also <a href=#>told</a> Jeff Lewis, "I'm sure the producers are trying to control the narrative, so I don't want to get into the mix of it. Who knows what their agenda is."</p><p dir=ltr>In other words, Lea wants nothing to do with reality television and she might be better off for it. After all, Black is still known as the societal mayor of Miami, with the Texan native focusing on organizing the Blacks' Annual Gala with her husband Roy Black, with the pair raising millions of dollars each year, per <a href=#>Aventura Magazine</a>. She also wrote a "tell-all" mystery about Miami's elite called "<a href=# rel=sponsored class=norewrite>Red Carpets & White Lies</a>," and put her house up for sale for a cool $34 million in Miami's exclusive Star Island, the <a href=#>Miami Herald</a> reported. Not to mention, she also has a podcast and <a href=#>CBD beauty line</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>So judging by how things are going for Lea, it doesn't look like she is in any need of a Bravo paycheck.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5ha313e9ahmK1lnJqubq7LmpqkZZanvK550Z6YpWWYpMK0sdairZ6rXaSzbrnImqSiZZmoera8jK2mZqyfma66ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-instant-noodles.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Instant Noodles [Official Taste Test]</span></a>
