<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Skin movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2009)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>As "Skin" begins, they run a little shop with a black clientele, but that doesn't make them liberal. When Sannie Laing (<a href=#>Alice Krige</a>) gets too friendly with the customers, her husband Abraham (<a href=#>Sam Neill</a>) tells her, "Be friendly with them but don't adopt them!"</p><p>He's outraged by any suggestion of African blood in his family. Sandra looks "coloured" to the people white and black who see her, but not to her parents. He fights all the way to the Supreme Court to have Sandra officially classified as white. Among his witnesses is a geneticist from Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, who testifies, "many and perhaps most Afrikaners have some non-white blood."</p><p>This was a <i>very</i> touchy subject in South Africa. I was aware of an Afrikaner student who hit another student when he was offered a pencil. That was an unmistakable reference to the infamous "pencil test": Stick a pencil through your hair and shake your head. The pencil will usually fall out of white hair, but not from black.</p><p>From being a cheerful child, Sandra now grows into a troubled adolescent (<a href=#>Sophie Okonedo</a>) who tries to bleach her skin. Her parents set up two disastrous dates with white boys. She falls in love with Petrus (<a href=#>Tony Kgoroge</a>), a young market gardener who is black, and her father chases him away with a rifle. Pregnant, she runs away from home, but now since she is officially considered white, it is a crime under apartheid for her to live with a black man.</p><p>The story of Sandra Laing (her real name) played out into the 1970s, and fascinated South Africa like no other. It cut directly into the official fiction that the races were separate and would never meet. She was proof that they'd been meeting a lot in the 400 years since the Dutch landed at Cape Town.</p><p>Sophie Okonedo you may remember from "<a href=#>Hotel Rwanda</a>" (2004), which won her an Oscar nomination. Born in London of a white mother and African father (which is very relevant here), she was in "<a href=#>Dirty Pretty Things</a>" (2002) and "<a href=#>The Secret Life of Bees</a>" (2008) -- remember the childlike May Boatwright? -- and has completed the title role in "Mrs. Mandela."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46soqKmXWd9cYU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chelsea-scott-on-southern-charm-why-did-shep-bring-her-to-the-party.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsea Scott on Southern Charm: Why did Shep bring her to the party?</span></a>
