<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Deceiver movie review &amp;amp; film summary (1998)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>''Deceiver'' is similar to ''The Usual Suspects'' in the way it coils around its central facts, looking at them first one way and then another. It also has a less obvious parallel with Quentin Tarantino's practice of working arcane knowledge into the dialogue of his characters. Carefully polished little set pieces are spotted through the film; the action stops for well-informed discussions about Vincent van Gogh, the dangers of absinthe, the symptoms of epilepsy and the relative intelligence of the two cops.</p><p>There wasn't much I could believe. The movie is basically about behavior--about acting, rather than about characters. The three leads and some supporting characters get big scenes and angry speeches, and the plot manufactures big moments of crisis and then slips away from them. It feels more like a play than a movie.</p><p>One of the ways it undermines its characters is by upstaging them with the plot. We get several theories about the death of the prostitute, and lots of flashbacks in which Wayland's tortured childhood offers explanations for actions he may or may not have taken. Facts are established, only to be shot down. Having seen the film twice, I am prepared to accept that its paradoxes are all answered and its puzzles solved, although unless you look closely and remember the face of an ambulance driver, you may miss the explanation for one of the big surprises.</p><p>The thing is, even after you figure it all out, a movie like this offers few rewards. It's well-acted, and you can admire that on a technical level, but the plot is such a puzzle it shuts us out: How can we care about events that the movie itself constantly undercuts and revises? By the time the final twist comes along, it's as if we've seen a clever show in which the only purpose, alas, was to demonstrate the cleverness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dnJydmauys3mQcnBx</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./250839-christen-harper-is-aspiring-actress-rams-html.html><span>←</span><span>Christen Harper Is an Aspiring Actress and Rams Quarterback Jared Goff's Girlfriend Get to Know</span></a>
