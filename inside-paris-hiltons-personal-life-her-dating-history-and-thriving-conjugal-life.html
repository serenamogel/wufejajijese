From the days of "That's Hot" and building a hotel empire, to catapulting to become a celebrated television personality, Paris is the blueprint for turning a spotlight into a global phenomenon. As Hilton's fans would agree, she's not just a name, she's a lifestyle brand. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on February 17, 1981, in NYC, to businessman<strong> Richard Hilton</strong>, and socialite<a href=#> Kathy Hilton</a>, Paris's privileged background provided her with platinum membership to the world from day one. Starting as a child model along with her mother and sister <strong>Nicky Hilton, </strong>It didn't take young Paris long to become the ultimate quintessential socialite extraordinaire, a reputation that she has since maintained, and even amplified by various means. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Inside Paris Hilton's Blissful Conjugal Life with Carter Reum! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Who would've thought that the professedly superficial Paris Hilton would be down to settle down for good? You are probably living under a rock if this is the first time you heard of Paris's blissful conjugal life with<strong> Carter Reum,</strong> a venture capitalist she married in 2021. Call it the magic of a new marriage or the twosome's genuine connection, but we're witnessing Hilton at her happiest. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/25/354524106_1387882048421391_8847329497123560869_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700911605209.jpg><p>The Hilton hotel heiress recently welcomed her secondborn with Reum and she is on cloud nine. The duo's romance started as a whirlwind affair and transcended into the realm of stability as Paris brought her glamour, and Carter brought his grounded nature. &nbsp;</p><p>The now-married couple go way back, in fact, both of them were in their 20s when they became acquaintances. But it was in 2019 that the glitzy Hilton and Carter struck up a romance. Hilton and Carter have <strong>Halle Hammond,</strong> Carter's sister, to be thankful for. It was at Hammond's 2019 Thanksgiving gathering that Hilton and Reum redefined their relationship. &nbsp;</p><p>The <i>Simple Life</i> star and her then-new beau went Instagram official within months of dating, and fast forward to Hilton's 40th birthday in 2021, the venture capitalist proposed to Hilton in the most romantic way imaginable. "I just started shaking and crying because I was so excited, so happy," the socialite said in her podcast, <i>This is Paris.</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/25/400052396_18412484557047688_5820477287058631678_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700911562880.jpg><p>The duo's engagement was followed by a string of candid statements from Paris, who also televised her love story in the Peacock's docu-series, <i>Paris in Love</i>. "So, I just feel now I'm an open book, I've put it all out there," said the socialite-turned-actress. The loved-up pair tied the knot on November 11, 2021, at Paris's grandfather's luxe home in Bel Air. &nbsp;</p><p>The duo's wedding ceremony, as fans and the industry had anticipated, was an extravagant affair. It was a celebration that could rival a royal affair, with stars like <strong>Kim Kardashian, Nicole Richie</strong>, and <strong>Paula Adbul</strong> filling the guest list. The pair followed the extended ceremony by embarking on a five-destination honeymoon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hilton televised her love story with Carter in the docu-series, 'Paris in Love'&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The Hilton heiress and Reum had longed for kids for a long time. Hilton even talked about delving into her IVF journey way before she and Carter exchanged their vows. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The pair reportedly underwent the IVF process during the lockdown and welcomed their firstborn, <strong>Phoenix</strong>, via a surrogate, earlier this year in January. &nbsp;"It's always been my dream to be a mother and I'm so happy that Carter and I found each other," the first-time mother gushed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/25/354529351_772704021069966_6887769465296941840_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700911569738.jpg><p>The twosome recently commemorated their second anniversary and not long after, announced the birth of their second baby via surrogacy. "Thankful for my baby girl," <a href=# rel=nofollow>Paris wrote</a> as she shared a snap of a cute Peter pan top and matching bottom, with her newborn's name, <strong>London</strong>, written on it. &nbsp;</p><h3>Everything to Know About Paris Hilton's Dating History! &nbsp;</h3><p>It's no surprise that Hilton boasts an exciting dating history. From A-list romances, casual flings, and broken engagements, to long romances, the socialite has done it all. Given her life-of-the-party persona, Paris was often seen arm-in-arm with some of the most eligible bachelors since the early days. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/25/401725368_18412708951047688_7063109757049570404_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700912009236.jpg><p>The list starts with model <strong>Jason Shaw,</strong> whom Hilton started dating in 2002. The pair reportedly got engaged during their short-lived romance before calling it off in 2003. In the years 2003 and 2004 alone, the socialite was linked with Sum 41 frontman<strong> Deryck Whibley</strong>, singer <strong>Nick Carter</strong>, and <strong>Paris Latsis</strong>, who was Hilton's fiance for a brief period. &nbsp;</p><p>The<i> Simple Life</i> star's dating history isn't devoid of some bitter experiences and the topic brings us to <strong>Rick Saloman</strong>, Paris's poker-playing beau in 2003. The duo's romance came to light when a sex tape, featuring Hilton and Rick got leaked in 2003. "I just felt so betrayed," said the socialite, who was later offered <i>$400,000 </i>of the tape's profits. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/25/403706513_18414877420047688_4349659125036587194_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700911578178.jpg><p>Hilton dated Greek heir <strong>Stavros Niarchos</strong> on and off from 2005 to 2007, before moving on with <strong>Josh Henderson</strong>, and later, with <strong>Benji Madden.</strong> Hilton's romantic history, before she met the love of her life Carter, was just a string of short-lived connections, including with actor <strong>Chris Zylka</strong>, with whom Paris got engaged for the third time, <strong>Adrian Grenier, Thomas Gross</strong>, and <strong>River Viiperi.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnqxrdGiqmagmaHBsLrSZqeeqqOku6K4jKWgn51dnbKzecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZZGjsW7Ax6ugr6GenHqku82jrKCZnGK5qrLE</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tate-yap.html><span>←</span><span>Tate Yap</span></a>
