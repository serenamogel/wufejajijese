<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Characteristics of exotic trees</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-exotic-trees></span>What are exotic trees?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>What are exotic tree</b> species? <b>Exotic tree</b> species are species introduced to an area where they do not occur naturally. Such species must initially be planted, but may be able to regenerate naturally later.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-advantages-of-exotic-trees></span>What are the advantages of exotic trees?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Benefits of Using <b>Exotic</b> Species<p>In general, <b>exotic</b> species have growing rates much greater than native species; therefore, they produce more wood per unit of area and time. In the tropics, <b>exotic</b> species could grow 5 to 10 times more wood than native species.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-indigenous-trees-important></span>Why are indigenous trees important?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Planting <b>indigenous trees</b> can improve the soil quality and can increase the water retention of the soil, therefore decreasing soil runoff and reducing ocean pollution. 2. <b>Trees</b> provide shelter and food for wildlife such as birds, squirrels and insects.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-plants-be-identified></span>How can plants be identified?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Most of the reference materials available to support <b>plant identification</b> rely on the observation of leaves and looking at their arrangement on the stem. The location and form (shape) of the <b>plant can</b> also be used to provide <b>identifying</b> clues.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-key-how-is-it-used-to-identify-a-plant></span>What is a key How is it used to identify a plant?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>ADVERTISEMENTS: A <b>key</b> is a device for easily <b>identifying</b> an unknown <b>plant</b> by a sequence of choices between two or more statements. A <b>key</b> is an artificial analytical device or arrangement where by a choice is provided between two contradictory characters resulting in the acceptance of one and the rejection of the other.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-you-tell-the-difference-between-a-leaf-and-a-leaflet></span>How can you tell the difference between a leaf and a leaflet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If the petiole (<b>leaf</b> stem) goes directly to the branch, it is a <b>leaf</b>. If it goes to another petiole before it goes to the branch, it is a <b>leaflet</b>. <b>Leaf</b> is part of a plant, a thin, flat structure usually green <b>in</b> color, attached to a stalk or the plant or tree itself. A <b>leaflet</b> is a printed pamplet for advertising.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-identify-bushes-by-their-leaves></span>How do I identify bushes by their leaves?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Shape is a better indicator than size, since individual <b>shrubs</b> can vary in <b>leaf</b> size. There are three basic <b>leaf</b> shapes, excluding those of conifers: lobed, smooth, and toothed. Lobed <b>leaves</b> have curvy or forked edges, such as oak <b>leaves</b>, while toothed <b>leaves</b> have many small teeth along the edges.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-an-app-to-identify-trees></span>Is there an app to identify trees?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Leafsnap is a new free <b>app</b> that identifies <b>trees</b>. Go for a walk, take a shot of a leaf and this little wonder will <b>identify</b> its tree and give all kinds of information about it. The <b>app</b> is a result of a collaboration between Columbia University, the University of Maryland and the Smithsonian Institution.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-3-types-of-leaves></span>What are the 3 types of leaves?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There are <b>three</b> basic <b>types of leaf</b> arrangements found in trees and shrubs: alternate, opposite, and whorled.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-you-tell-a-perennial-from-a-leaf></span>How can you tell a perennial from a leaf?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Look at the base of the <b>leaf</b>, and if there is a bud there, it is a simple <b>leaf</b>. If you find the bud at the base of a grouping of <b>leaves</b>, they are compound <b>leaves</b>. Next, look at how <b>leaves</b> are positioned in relation to each other. If <b>leaves</b> occur in pairs directly opposite each other, they are called opposite <b>leaves</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-there-an-app-to-identify-leaves></span>Is there an app to identify leaves?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Plantifier. Free on <b>Android</b> and iOS. This crowdsourced plant recognition <b>app</b> allows you to upload an image of an unknown plant; <b>the</b> users of <b>the</b> MyGarden.org community attempt to <b>identify the</b> plant and answer questions.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46cn5qqkZjBpr7IrKuim6NivKd5xLGmraGTYsGzscSsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sodastream-mtn-dew-news.html><span>←</span><span>SodaStream Mtn Dew: DIY Dew Is Coming Soon</span></a>
