Just a month after the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one-year anniversary of his death</a>, his family is saying goodbye to another beloved sibling — this time, his older sister <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobbie Jean</a></strong>. Bobbie Jean, who often went by BJ, passed away on Dec. 23, 2023, leaving eight-year-old daughter Bella behind.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true>Bobbie Jean was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the fourth Carter sibling</a> to pass away between 2012 and 2023, and the second loss in 2023 alone, leaving the Carter family with a tragic start to their holidays. Fans of the former House of Carter star are sharing their heartbreak online, and celebrating the tumultuous lives of the ill-fated family.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>BJ wasn’t nearly so popular as her older brother Nick (of Backstreet Boys fame) or Aaron, who enjoyed a lengthy singing and on-screen career through his childhood and teens, but she did appear in the single season of their Kardashian-style series, House of Carter. Between that on-screen stint and her work as Aaron’s wardrobe stylist and makeup artist during his early 2000s touring days, the oldest Carter sister racked up a solid net worth.</p><h2 id=h-bobby-jean-carter-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Bobby Jean Carter’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/House-of-Carter.jpg><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Carter was involved, but not completely embroiled, in the professional lives of her famous siblings. She was most involved with Aaron’s career, working alongside him behind the scenes during his early 2000s peak, and agreeing to join the single-season reality series House of Carter. The series was relatively short-lived but exposed the drama-soaked and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sometimes troubling lives</a> the Carters lived behind the scenes.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>The final episode of the single-season series also revealed BJ’s struggle with alcohol abuse, something that reportedly followed her throughout her life. It’s old news by now that being a child star, and growing up in these types of famous households, can be severely damaging, but each time a new example crops up fans are distressed anew. You’d think, with so many examples of struggling stars at our fingertips, Hollywood might learn a thing or two.</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=false>Despite the issues her involvement with her famous family caused, BJ did manage to stack up a solid net worth while working with her siblings. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Net Worth Post</a>, she was worth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as much as $12 to $14 million</a> at some points during her life, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">also worth as little</a> as $200,000 to $500,000. That lower number is still more in the bank than many Americans will ever see, so we can only hope it was a help to BJ as she worked to leave behind the issues that plagued much of the Carter family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZq6aq12WrrO7zWaamqqkmr%2B0edKiqq2domKvsK7BopxmopWWu26vwKurnqqjYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-im-just-vibin-extended-version-by-ritz-car-17.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Im Just Vibin (Extended Version) by Ritz Car #17</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
