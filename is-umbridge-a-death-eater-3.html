Hermione tricked Umbridge into following Harry and herself into the Forbidden Forest to search for Dumbledore’s alleged “secret weapon”.

As a result, Umbridge was carried off and nearly killed by the herd.</p><p>Is Mrs Umbridge evil?

It was not enough to only have seen it or know about it.</p><p>How did Umbridge get locket? So Umbridge acquires the locket <b>as a bribe from Mundungus Fletcher</b>, and though it once belonged to Salazar Slytherin, Merope Gaunt, and Hepzibah Smith, Umbridge is unaware that the locket is one of Lord Vodemort’s Horcruxes – or that it belonged to him at all.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_sent_the_howler_to_Petunia></span>Who sent the howler to Petunia?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A Howler from <b>Dumbledore</b>, addressed to Petunia, said ‘Remember my last’ – no doubt referring to the letter which he left with baby Harry, on the doorstep of Privet Drive.
