<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom movie review (2018)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Reviewing the 1993 “<a href=#>Jurassic Park</a>,” my friend and colleague Janet Maslin wrote about the film’s potent frights and then added: “Much scarier, however, are those aspects of 'Jurassic Park' that establish it as the overnight flagship of a brand-new entertainment empire. Even while capturing the imagination of its audience, this film lays the groundwork for the theme-park rides, sequels and souvenirs that insure the 'Jurassic Park' experience will live on. And on. And on.”</p><p>While “King Kong” spawned one sort-of sequel, and a spinoff, and a couple of remakes, what Maslin was talking about here was something different, and has absolutely come to pass. As such, what a dinosaur movie should be is now, with “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,” what the entertainment empire demands.</p><p>Directed by J.A. Bayona from a script by <a href=#>Colin Trevorrow</a> and <a href=#>Derek Connolly</a>, “Fallen Kingdom” opens with a few DNA pirates on a stealth mission at the now-abandoned-by-humans island park where the dinosaurs still roam. These bootleggers get away, not quite clean, of course, because we need the pre-credits chomping sequence the way a Bond movie needs a non-diegetic stunt opener. After this we learn that a volcano is about to rock said island and make fossils of all the lizards once more. Should they be saved? <a href=#>Jeff Goldblum</a>’s Dr. Malcolm speaks to a congressional committee with metaphors that limn a global-warming allegory—the only time the movie tries to make anything resembling a statement—and says, let nature take its course. <a href=#>Bryce Dallas Howard</a>’s Claire, however, now running a save-the-dinosaurs nonprofit, is frustrated by congressional inaction and heartened by a call from Eli Mills, who’s now running the concern that manufactured the dinos in the first place. Mills, played by <a href=#>Rafe Spall</a> as if channeling <a href=#>Alessandro Nivola</a>, shows Claire a new sanctuary he’s carved out for the creatures. He has a particular interest in super-smart raptor “<a href=#>Blue</a>,” who was so sensitively trained by <a href=#>Chris Pratt</a>’s Owen.</p><p>So yes, we’re getting the band back together. Joining up are two new members, from Claire’s crew: feisty dino-medic Zia Rodriguez—<a href=#>Daniella Pineda</a>, whom some may recognize from the indie comedy “<a href=#>Mr. Roosevelt</a>”—and computer nerd Franklin, played by <a href=#>Justice Smith</a> in a characterization that suggests TV’s Urkel as reimagined by <a href=#>Wes Anderson</a>. Once on the island whilst dodging dinosaurs and lava—“Oh God, it’s hot!” “It’s about to get a whole lot hotter.”— the foursome discovers a double cross perpetrated by a head hunter played by <a href=#>Ted Levine</a>. After nearly drowning in a pod, dodging balls of hot lava, and fleeing other CGI-generated perils, Claire and Owen and party stow away on the ship transporting captured dinosaurs to who knows where. After a refreshing sleep, the two leads awake with perfect hair and makeup and not a scuff on their skins or clothing. I know it’s pointless to complain about realism in movies such as these but I laughed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46jrKuZo6i2pHnWqKmlnF2brq24xKdkpKGenLGwuYxrZ2pw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joao-cancelo-net-worth-290346.html><span>←</span><span>Joo Cancelo Net Worth</span></a>
