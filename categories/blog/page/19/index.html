I drank for many years in a tavern that had a photograph of Brendan Behan on the wall, and under it this quotation, which I memorized:
"I respect kindness in human beings first of all, and kindness to animals.I don't respect the law; I have a total irreverence for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer, the beer stronger, the food cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Marvel fans are here for James McAvoy complaining the X-Men movies werent gay enough</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>

Southern Charm has been turning up the drama this season. Austen Kroll has found himself in the middle of it all and it came to a head last night on the season finale.
Earlier this season, Austen Kroll was shown on video with two other women as his girlfriend Madison LeCroy came in. The footage was played on Southern Charm, and while it looked like the reported transgression was done and over with, it came back to life during a party thrown by Patricia Altschul.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Skin movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2009)</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>

As you may recall the GTX 550 Ti launched at $150, a price tag too high for its sub-6850 performance. I’m not sure in what order things happened – whether it was a price change or a competitive card that came first – but GTX 550 Ti prices have finally come down for some of the cards.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Is Jelly Drink and How Do You Make It?</h2><time>Aug 9, 2024</time>

Here’s a brief story about my mom: A few years ago, we went on a family trip to San Francisco. My mom noticed signs around for bubble tea, something she had never tried or even heard of before. She made it her mission to sample bubble tea (or boba tea) during our trip. On the last day of the vacation, while walking around Chinatown, she finally walked into a restaurant, ordered a bubble tea, sat down, and took a sip.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/18/>← Prev Page</a>
