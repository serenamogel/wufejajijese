<a href=../../../../claras-ghost-2018.html></a>
With a promising kick-off that dies down fast, “Clara’s Ghost” drops us into an eerily deserted road—Ted (Chris Elliott) and Clara (Paula Niedert Elliott) are in the midst of their nighttime road trip during which something terrible happens. OK, scratch the “terrible” part—it’s only Clara’s shoe that goes missing. Still, she takes the liberty to report this laughable non-incident to the authorities, who clearly can’t care less. Not that their indifference registers with Clara—tone-deafness runs in her show biz-focused family she’s about to join for a reunion weekend.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Demetrius Shipp Jr. movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>

Rapper&nbsp;Remy Ma&nbsp;recently told daytime talk show host Wendy Williams that she did not shoot her former friend in a July 2007 scuffle that sent her to prison, despite her attorney’s claims that she did otherwise.&nbsp;
The “Melanin Magic” rapper appeared virtually on the Wednesday, March 31, episode of “The Wendy Williams Show,” where the two women discussed a plethora of things, including Remy’s pregnancy rumor infamously started by her husband Papoose, motherhood, and much more.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>If These Were White Women: Nevada Mom, Two Daughters Who Were Handcuffed, Searched and Wro</h2><time>Aug 28, 2024</time>

A California mother and her two daughters who were wrongfully detained outside of a Starbucks more than three years ago finally got some justice. A federal jury awarded $8.25 million to the family after they were unlawfully searched and detained by Alameda County sheriff’s deputies in Castro Valley, California. The mother was taking one of her daughters to take a college math test in Berkeley, which is about 45 minutes away from the Starbucks where the incident took place.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sakra movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>

A shameless magpie, Wong, and his influence feel weirdly relevant to Yen and his three credited co-writers’ understanding of the wuxia genre. (Yen also credits Wong with bringing “Sakra” to his attention) Rather than try to modernize the dialogue or update the visual language of Cha’s novel, Yen and his collaborators have made their characters speak and move like the protagonists of an unabashedly pulpy costume drama. They wistfully lecture each other about filial piety and social responsibility whenever they’re not practicing neatly labeled action moves, like the Powerful Vajra Palm.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Should sheathing be pressure treated?</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../should-sheathing-be-pressure-treated.html></a>
As long as there's a good chance that moisture can reach the wood, it should be pressure treated. This is why the International Building Code requires that siding and structural lumber used for the last six inches of the structure above the ground is pressure treated. Should plywood sheathing be pressure treated? One best practice for wall sheathing that I learned from Matt Risinger is to use pressure treated plywood as the lowest course of wall sheathing to help prevent rot, since that is the most prone to wetting.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ugliest House in Americas strangest finds, ranked</h2><time>Aug 27, 2024</time>
