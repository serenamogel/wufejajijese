So, many of us obliged his wishes and stocked our cabinets with the skinny, brown meaty sticks. They were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">great for road trips</a> and even better to bring to school for a snack and a round of “Macho Man” impressions on the playground. But looking back, what the heck were those things? What is a Slim Jim? What’s in a Slim Jim? What are Slim Jims made of? How are Slim Jims made? And are you supposed to peel a Slim Jim? Let’s find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-a-slim-jim><strong>What is a Slim Jim?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Slim Jims are a “meat stick” long boi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">convenience store staple</a> that are a blend of beef jerky and a pepperoni stick. They are a processed meat snack made and sold by the food conglomerate ConAgra. They were invented by Adolph Levis (he smartly went by Al) in Philadelphia and originally sold as a bar snack housed in glass jars of vinegar. Back in the 1940s, many bar patrons would snack on pickled things or cured meats while drinking. And while pepperoni was popular, it took a long time to cure and it was considered a little unsightly to chomp on them big logs in public. Slim Jims and their dainty girth were the answer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BEST-BEEF-STICKS-RANKING_DANNY-PALUMBO_SPORKED_HEADER-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-beef-sticks><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Beef Sticks</a></h2><p>Slim Jims certainly have their place but if you’re looking for the best beef sticks, we have 11 beef stick brands to try</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-are-slim-jims-made-of><strong>What are Slim Jims made of?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>If you really like Slim Jims, it may be best if you remain in the dark about what’s in a Slim Jim. Slim Jims are made of a lot of the same stuff that normal sausage is made of—there’s a meat base mixed with a lactic acid starter culture, just like in salami or pepperoni. There’s dextrose that serves as food for the starter culture. Salt acts to keep water away from the microbial activity and prevent spoilage. But outside of traditional sausage making, how are Slim Jims really made? Well, Slim Jims most likely use low grade beef. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">USDA’s bottom three</a> are utility, cutter, and canner and are typically used in processed foods. That beef is combined with mechanically separated chicken. This combo would turn an unappetizing shade of gray if left to its own devices, so sodium nitrite is added to give Slim Jims their nice red-brown color. They also throw in some hydrolyzed soy, which acts as an MSG-like flavor enhancer. And there’s corn and wheat proteins in there because ConAgra has a lot of corn and wheat and they can use it as filler.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-do-you-eat-a-slim-jim><strong>How do you eat a Slim Jim?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>To eat a Slim Jim you take it out of the plastic wrapper, then bite a piece off, then chew until it’s a pretty mushy consistency, and then swallow. After that, it’s up to your body.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RL_SlimJim-1170x658.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rhett-link-rank-slim-jim-flavors><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rhett & Link Rank Slim Jim Flavors</a></h2><p>Rhett & Link tried all of the Slim Jim flavors, so let’s take a stroll through their top four picks to see which meat sticks stuck out as the snackiest, snappiest Slim Jims of them all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-you-supposed-to-peel-a-slim-jim><strong>Are you supposed to peel a Slim Jim?</strong></h2><p>Honestly, this is something I have never even considered. I did some research and it turns out that there are indeed people out there that have gone on forums and asked this question about peeling a Slim Jim. Yeah, I know it’s kind of plasticky and greasy, but it’s processed meat. You can peel it if you want, but then you’re just going to have loose Slim Jim innards. If that’s what you want, then peel away. But the short answer is no, you are not supposed to peel a Slim Jim. That said, this is America, home of the Slim Jim, and I will support your right to make a mess of your meat sticks however you choose. Let’s peel these Slim Jims together!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmmGarnJ66brbIpmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./untogether-2019.html><span>←</span><span>Untogether movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</span></a>
