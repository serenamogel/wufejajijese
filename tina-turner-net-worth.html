But what was Tina's exact net worth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, what was Tina Turner's net worth?</h2><p>The beloved songstress accrued a seriously impressive net worth over her decades in the music industry. With a dollar valuation of somewhere around $250 million, she has clearly benefitted from her countless chart-topping hits, touring, and various endorsement deals.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Tina Turner</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer, Dancer</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $250 million</p><p>Tina Turner was a singer, dancer, actress, and author known as the Queen of Rock 'n' Roll</p><ul><li><strong>Birthdate:</strong> Nov. 26, 1939</li><li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Brownsville, Tenn.</li><li><strong>Birth name:</strong> Anna Mae Bullock</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> Floyd Richard Bullock</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Zelma Priscilla Bullock (née Currie)</li><li><strong>Marriages:</strong> Ike Turner (m. 1962, div. 1978), Erwin Bach (m. 2013–2023)</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> Craig, Ronnie, Ike Jr., Michael</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Sumner High School</li></ul><p>There's a general consensus that Tina's net worth was severely impacted by her divorce from Ike Turner.

In the doc, Tina explained some of the more troubling details of her life. She candidly discussed her marriage and divorce from Ike, who died in 2007 due to a drug overdose.</p><p>In detailing her PTSD from the abuse she claims to have experienced at his hands, Tina said, "For a long time I did hate Ike, I have to say that, but then, after he died, I really realized that he was an ill person. He did get me started and he was good to me in the beginning. So I have some good thoughts. Maybe it was a good thing that I met him. That I don’t know."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Tina Turner's cause of death?</h2><p>Tina Turner died on May 24, 2023, in Switzerland, where she had been living with her husband, prestigious German music producer Erwin Bach. She and Erwin got married in 2013.</p><p>Tina had been suffering from health issues for several years. In 2017, she underwent a kidney transplant; Erwin donated one of his kidneys to her.</p><p>To say that Tina Turner will be missed is a gigantic understatement. Her legacy is one of fierce power and talent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbavrYytrKumlad6r7HTZq6oqqSd</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nas-magic-tracklist-shares-magic-2-featuring-50-cent-21-savage.html><span>←</span><span>Nas Magic Tracklist Shares Magic 2 Featuring 50 Cent &amp;amp; 21 Savage</span></a>
