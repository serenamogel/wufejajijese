I really hate to call out my girlfriend in a Sporked article, but I have little choice. While she’s a great person in many respects, she just doesn’t care about sauces. This, to me, is close to heresy. I am a gigantic sauce fan, slathering Tabasco and Frank’s on most of my food to the point that some people (i.e. my girlfriend) have accused me of not even being able to taste the underlying dish anymore.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ben Hardy Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</h2><time>Jun 28, 2024</time>

I love cookie butter (it was really hard not to write that sentence without using two expletives so use your imagination, they go before “love” and after “cookie”). I like cookie butter the way creepy fans like pop-stars or addicts like their poison of choice. It’s not a healthy relationship, so I generally try to stay away from it. I can’t even have the stuff in the house. Leave me alone with a jar of cookie butter and I’ll go goblin mode, black out, then wake up 12 hours later in a jail cell.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is diagonals of rectangle are equal?</h2><time>Jun 27, 2024</time>
