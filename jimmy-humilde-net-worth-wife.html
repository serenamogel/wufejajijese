Therefore, Jimmy Humilde has an estimated net worth of $5 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The genres are fairly niche and were historically associated with an alt-music culture that didn’t necessarily have its own place in the mainstream. But today, corrido tumbao is as much a state of mind as it is a musical genre, and it has fuelled Humilde’s popularity.&nbsp;</span></p><p>“A corrido tumbao is a state of mind, a way of dressing, acting,” Jimmy told <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a>.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>His label – Rancho Humilde – is one of the biggest Latin music labels operating out of southern California, and he is responsible for promoting musicians including Junior H and Nataneal Cano.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Humilde is incredibly proud of the musical movement that he has helped to launch and sees it as a representation of his Mexican American culture.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He believes corridos transcends stereotypes and is something that people from all over can appreciate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><p><strong>Where does Jimmy Humilde live?</strong></p><p>Renowned music producer Jimmy Humilde resides in the United States, specifically in Downey, Southeast Los Angeles, California.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Joe Bonsall</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfn7auudhmn66lmaGxpnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal51qKdnmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elijah-garcia-wikipedia-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Boxer Elijah Garcia?
