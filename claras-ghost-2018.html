<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Clara's Ghost movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2018)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-children-count=0>With a promising kick-off that dies down fast, “Clara’s Ghost” drops us into an eerily deserted road—Ted (Chris Elliott) and Clara (<a href=#>Paula Niedert Elliott</a>) are in the midst of their nighttime road trip during which something terrible happens. OK, scratch the “terrible” part—it’s only Clara’s shoe that goes missing. Still, she takes the liberty to report this laughable non-incident to the authorities, who clearly can’t care less. Not that their indifference registers with Clara—tone-deafness runs in her show biz-focused family she’s about to join for a reunion weekend. The festive occasion is organized to celebrate the birthday of their beloved dog Reynolds; an adorable, wise-looking canine that serves as a welcome departure from the annoying crowd of humans who can learn a thing or two from the good boy.</p><p data-children-count=0>Among them are siblings Riley (the writer-director Elliott) and Julie (<a href=#>Abby Elliott</a>); a pair of once-upon-a-time child stars à la the Olsen twins Mary-Kate and Ashley, of a vintage TV series called “The Sweet Sisters.” A true prima donna with a sassy attitude, Julie still seems to have a lucrative career, while the comparatively tormented Riley appears to have fallen from grace just like her famous actor dad Ted. Also in the mix is the kindly and somewhat bullied family friend Joe, played by the sorely missed (no, genuinely) <a href=#>Haley Joel Osment</a> of “<a href=#>The Sixth Sense</a>”, who surely knows a great deal about both ghosts and prematurely fizzled out childhood stardom. Clara on the other hand is no celebrity and has zero personal ties to the entertainment industry—yet she ends up being the sole target of the sorrowful ghost of a woman (played by <a href=#>Isidora Goreshter</a>), who once reigned over the country estate the bickering, quarrelling and score-settling family now occupies.</p><p data-children-count=0>Over a long, “Who’s Afraid of <a href=#>Virginia Woolf</a>”-ish boozy night, secrets and spiteful enmities (both professional and familial) pour out of bitterly competitive mouths one by one, which only give way to more alcohol in a vicious circle. When the titular ghost finally infiltrates Clara (but honestly, who knows what’s really happening after all that drinking), she at once equips her flesh-and-blood vessel with the kind of destructive agency the neglected Clara had long been missing. Except, Clara’s egotistical family still doesn’t seem to take notice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46co5qqkah6qLTOrKtmamBmhQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./monronalives.html><span>←</span><span>Monronalives- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Boyfriend, Dating, Height, Career</span></a>
