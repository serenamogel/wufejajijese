Her two sisters are&nbsp;Kelli King and&nbsp;Hunter&nbsp;King. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Joey King’s Sisters are&nbsp;Actresses</h2><p>The eldest amongst the three King sisters,&nbsp;Kelli, was born on March 22, 1992. She&nbsp;made her acting debut way back in 1998 as a child actress with the film The Christmas Path. Following that, she appeared in a few more TV series and movies. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, her career never flourished in the entertainment industry like her other two sisters, who have comparatively more success. Her prominent acting credits include <a href=# rel=follow>Grey’s Anatomy</a> and The Winner.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Kelli’s last on-screen appearance was in 2012 when she starred in a short TV series,&nbsp;Youth Pastor Kevin. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hunter, who is over a year younger than Kelli, has 20 credits as an actress so far. She is best known for her roles as&nbsp;Adriana Masters in Hollywood Heights,&nbsp;Summer Newman in <a href=# rel=follow>The Young and the Restless</a>, and&nbsp;Clementine Hughes in Life in Pieces. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She has been a regular cast of&nbsp;the soap opera&nbsp;The Young and the Restless since 2012, with&nbsp;appearances in over 758 episodes. The show has released 49 seasons so far.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Hunter, born Hayley Ashley King, was&nbsp;credited as Haley King earlier in her career that started&nbsp;with the 2001 movie&nbsp;AI Artificial Intelligence. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>What Are Joey King’s Sisters Doing Now?</h2><p>Kelli, who has kept herself away from the entertainment industry for a long time, is&nbsp;active on Instagram with over 68,000 followers. Her feed shows that she is a lover of neon lights and has been in a relationship with her partner.</p><p>She and her partner, who goes by the username @moyk9 on Instagram, are often snapped traveling around the world, posting eye-catching snaps.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But Hunter seems involved in her career as she drops pictures from her shoots and uploads&nbsp;sponsor posts. In addition, she is also a social media influencer with over 676,000 followers on Instagram. As an influencer, she often talks about varied topics, from fashion trends to mental health. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The Sisters Are Very Close to Each Other</h2><p>The King sisters, born to their parents&nbsp;Jamie and Terry King, are close to each other and do not seem to have any sourness in their relationship, despite being associated with the same profession. They are also often spotted sharing pictures, especially on special occasions like birthdays and family gatherings.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking to Entertainment Weekly</a> in April 2019, Joey and Hunter expressed that they wanted to work together on a project. “We’ve always talked about how we want to work together and I told my boss that I really want her to come and play and be on the show,” Hunter said.</p><p>Joey also had some wonderful things to say about her relationship with Hunter, as she shared, “Hunter and I, we get along really well. We’re like best friends. We don’t really fight ever.”</p><p>Hopefully, we get to see these sisters together in a film or TV show in the coming future. And&nbsp;Kelli can also make a guest appearance. That sounds like a great idea!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKKfmsZut8innmarmZe5qrrGrGWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./style-hard-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-475299-html.html><span>←</span><span>Style Hard Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
