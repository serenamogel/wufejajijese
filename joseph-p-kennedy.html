Kennedy?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Joseph P. Kennedy is best known for being the father of three political leaders: President John F. Kennedy, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, who served as a U.S. senator and attorney general. Kennedy became a bank president by age 25, also holding positions as a shipyard manager and movie studio owner. By age 30, he was a millionaire. In 1937, Kennedy became the first Irish-American ambassador to Britain, serving in that position until 1940.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on September 6, 1888, to an Irish Catholic family in Boston, Massachusetts, Joseph Patrick Kennedy overcame the class prejudices of the era and enrolled at Harvard University. He graduated from the school in 1912, and, by the age of 25, had become president of a bank. He also found work as a shipyard manager around this time, and became known as a large contributor to the Democratic Party.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1914, Kennedy married <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/rose-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rose Fitzgerald" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rose Fitzgerald</a>; the couple would eventually raise four sons, Joseph Patrick "Joe" Jr. (born in 1915), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Fitzgerald" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Fitzgerald</a> (born in 1917), <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/robert-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Francis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Francis</a> (born in 1925) and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ted-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='Edward "Ted" Moore' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Edward "Ted" Moore</a> (born in 1932), and five daughters: Rose Marie "Rosemary" (born in 1918), Kathleen Agnes "Kick" (born in 1920), Eunice Mary (born in 1921), Patricia (born in 1924) and Jean Ann (born in 1928). The Kennedy children were encouraged to read the New York Times at an early age, and only national issues were discussed during dinner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Always financially astute, brilliant and driven, Kennedy became a millionaire by the age of 30 through investments in the movie business and alcohol distribution. He ran a movie studio in the 1920s, during which time he had an affair with actress Gloria Swanson. Kennedy retired from stock trading at age 41, amassing enough capital to build million-dollar trust funds for each of his nine children.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Political Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 1932 presidential election, Kennedy supported <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-d-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin D. Roosevelt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who, in turn, named Kennedy chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934. Shortly thereafter, he was appointed as chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1937, Kennedy became the first Irish American to serve as the U.S. British ambassador, a position he held for three years thereafter; he resigned in 1940, convinced that Britain would be taken over by Nazi Germany and that America's only hope lay in staying out of the coming conflict. According to a November 1940 article in the Boston Sunday Globe, upon returning from England on the eve of World War II, Kennedy said, "Democracy is finished in England. It may be here." His controversial views earned him a reputation as an anti-Semite and appeaser of Hitler, in addition to perceptions that he was a womanizer and probably had ties to organized crime.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the loss of his first son, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., during WWII, Kennedy stepped back from public life and concentrated on grooming his three remaining sons for political office.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Final Years</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kennedy suffered a debilitating stroke in 1961. He died at the Kennedy compound, on Cape Cod along Nantucket Sound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, on November 18, 1969, at the age of 81.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.historyvault.com/collections/biography?cmpid=HV_Bio_Joe_Kennedy" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='Watch "Joseph Kennedy Sr.: The Father of an American Dynasty" on HISTORY Vault' class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Watch "Joseph Kennedy Sr.: The Father of an American Dynasty" on HISTORY Vault</a></strong></p><img alt="Edgar Allan Poe" title="Edgar Allan Poe" width=700 height=200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/editorial-promo-700x200-svod-hvault-topics-biography.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Joseph Patrick Kennedy</li><li>Birth Year: 1888</li><li>Birth date: September 6, 1888</li><li>Birth State: Massachusetts</li><li>Birth City: Boston</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Joseph P.
