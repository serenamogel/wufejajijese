If you are going to use disinfectant wipes they must also be free of bleach. After all of this, you are going to want to immediately rinse off the surface using a sponge or wet towel.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Beside above, what should you not use on quartz countertops?</h3><p>Scrub with Harsh Scouring Pads The steel wool pads impregnated with soap you can find at your local supermarket should be kept away from your quartz countertops.
