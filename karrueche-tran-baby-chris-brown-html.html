She took to Twitter to indirectly inform that she was ending her relationship with Brown.</p><p>"Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me," she tweeted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On the other hand, the tabloid reported the singer was happy about being a father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sometime later, Brown&nbsp;took responsibility for his daughter, born on May 27, 2014, and even <a href=# rel=follow>fought for her custody</a>.</p><h2>Karrueche Tran Was 'Completely Mortified' by Baby News</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The baby news definitely came as a shock for both&nbsp;Tran and Brown, as even the singer found out about the child after her birth.</p><p>But as for Tran, the news was a hard pill to swallow. That is because her then-boyfriend had apparently cheated on her and had a child with another partner. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to People</a>, right after the news was broke, Brown was still trying to get ahold of the actress by calling and texting her time and again.</p><p>However, Tran, who had reportedly decided never to see him again, didn't bother responding to him.</p><p>And as she implied in her previous tweet, she didn't want to be part of the&nbsp;drama, too.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>A close source also told the tabloid that the actress was hanging out with her friends when she found out the news. After hearing it, she felt she was "blindsided" by the singer and was "completely mortified."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>That said, she also found an opportunity to "leave it behind her and move on with her life." "She's seeing it as an opportunity to start fresh," the source added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Karrueche Tran and Chris Brown's Fight</h2><p>A few months after the initial&nbsp;drama,&nbsp;Tran and Brown got involved in a public fight right out of the actress' house.</p><p>A report from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a> reported that&nbsp;Brown was attempting to rekindle his romance with Tran when both of them were at a nightclub. But since she was not interested, she left the place and sat in her SUV. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The singer reportedly chased her and tried to get inside her car. However, she again didn't want him inside her car, too.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Sometime later at night, when she was at her home, he showed up outside and started banging her door. The incident eventually led to an unhealthy argument.</p><p>At present, <a href=# rel=follow>Tran is single</a> and focused on growing her career as an actress.
