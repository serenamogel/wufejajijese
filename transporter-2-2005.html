<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Transporter 2 movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2005)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>But not another word about that. Jason Statham is amusing as a man whose emotions are so well under control that he can barely be bothered to have any. He stars in several martial arts sequences in which he wipes out whole platoons of enemies. They're deployed by Gianni (<a href=#>Alessandro Gassman</a>), a really big, really mean, really smart villain. Modine efficiently plays the role of the sniveling bureaucrat, Amber Valetta is effective as his long-suffering wife, and Kate Nauta plays Lola, a deadly vixen who considers herself dressed after she's troweled on her eye makeup; for Lola, it's run, mascara, run.</p><p>There's a development of some interest to students of product placement. The Transporter drives an Audi. The first shots of the titles play like a commercial for the car. It's quite a car, all right, taking full advantage of the all-wheel drive as it survives those incredible stunts. So sturdy is its construction that after it crashes through the concrete wall while jumping to the other building, there's not even a scratch on the shiny silver circles on the front of the car.</p><p>There is some history here. In the original film, Frank Martin drove a BMW. Now he drives the Audi. Apparently BMW did not sign on for the sequel.</p><p>Strange: On the very same day I saw this movie, I saw another thriller, "Memory of a Killer," in which the characters hate BMWs so much, they urinate into the cars' keyholes. In between, I saw a movie about <a href=#>Truman Capote</a> that mostly featured Chevrolets, which must come as a relief to the BMW home office in Bavaria. It's bad enough when The Transporter switches brands, but when Capote drops you, you're over.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tqZqmo6W8s8DEq2RrZWJlfXY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-jenna-ortega-dating-johnny-depp-is-johnny-depp-in-a-relationship-2023-latest-news.html><span>←</span><span>Is Jenna Ortega Dating Johnny Depp, Is Johnny Depp in a Relationship 2023, -Latest News</span></a>
